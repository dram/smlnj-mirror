== Summary

This is a patch release that includes a few bug fixes and
adds support for *macOS 12* (Monterey).

== Details

=== SML/NJ Library

Several improvements to the *JSON* library:
--
* Added convenience function `int` to the `JSON_STREAM_OUTPUT` interface.

* Refactored the output modules in the *JSON* library.  These changes should
  not affect current clients of the library, but allow the addition of
  printing *JSON* to a `CharBuffer.buf`.

* Bug fix to `JSONUtil` module; the `FIND` path arc was not getting
  handled for the update functions (_i.e._, `replace`, `insert`, and `append`).
--

=== 32-bit macOS issues

While the {dist-dir}smlnj-x86-{version}.pkg[x86 installer]
for {version} works on **macOs** 10.14 Mojave, building from source
requires some extra steps because the version of **Xcode**
distributed for Mojave does not include a 32-bit SDK.

Another issue that you may encounter
when building on **macOs** 10.14 Mojave is an error message for a shell
script of the form

.....
  /bin/sh: bad interpreter: Operation not permitted
.....

This error arises because the `com.apple.quarantine` attribute is set on the
shell script.  To fix the problem, remove the attribute using the command

[source,shell]
-----
  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine shell-script
-----
and resume the build.
