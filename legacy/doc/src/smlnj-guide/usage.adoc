== Interactive Usage

The quickest way to use **SML/NJ** is to run the `sml` command from
the shell, which brings up the interactive system.

[source,shell]
------------
% sml
Standard ML of New Jersey (64-bit) v110.99.1 [built: Mon Apr 12 18:45:14 2021]
-
------------

At this point, you can enter SML top-level declarations and expressions
terminated by a semicolon.  These will be immediately checked, compiled,
and executed.  Assuming that there are no errors, the result of the
compilation is then printed.  For example,

[source,sml]
------------
- fun f x = x;
val f = fn : 'a -> 'a
------------

== Putting Code in Files

== Building Programs with the Compilation Manager

// CM files
// CM.make

== Building Programs from the Shell

// ml-build
// ml-makedepend
