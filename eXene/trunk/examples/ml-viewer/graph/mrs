Subject: deleting edges in graphs
Date: Thu, 12 Aug 93 18:24:05 D

Have you thought about providing a function that allows you to delete
an edge by providing its endpoints only as arguments.

delEdge' : graph * {hd : node, tl : node} -> unit.

If more than one edge existed with the given endpoints, you would only 
delete one edge.
