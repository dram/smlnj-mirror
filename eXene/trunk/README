This is the first pre-release/alpha version of what we shall call eXene 2.0,
which is based on the "fifth pre-release version of eXene 1.0" (see README-1.0
for details). This version offers a few enhancements to this previous release,
including improved X authorization code, improved support for working with
X resources (eg, .xrdb files), some widget deadlock-avoidance code, and support
for receiving window deletion events from the X window manager. More such updates
are to come (we promise!), but this release is provided in case eXene users wish
to take advantage of a few of these features early. Because of a few API changes
(see CHANGES for details) and more upcoming improvements, we have named this
release eXene 2.0a. Please feel free to contact us with any bug reports, 
suggestions, or critiques.
