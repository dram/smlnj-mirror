Summary:

     A number of small, but important bug fixes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Details:

      * Fixed a space leak in the CML implementation of TextIO and
	BinIO.

      * Fixed the handling of %g in the Format library module.

      * Ported to MacOS X 10.2 (Jaguar).  The MacOS X 10.1 and 10.2 runtime
	systems are different.  The former is called run.ppc-darwin5
	and the latter is run.ppc-darwin.

      * Fixed a bug in division by zero on the PowerPC.

      * Sml now senses the SMLNJ_HOME environment variable.  If this is set,
	then the bin dir is assumed to be in $SMLNJ_HOME/bin and (unless
	CM_PATHCONFIG is also set), the path configuration file is assumed
	to be in $SMLNJ_HOME/lib/pathconfig.  This way one can easily move
	the entire tree to some other place and everything will "just work".
	Companion commands such as ml-build and ml-makedepend also sense this
	variable.
