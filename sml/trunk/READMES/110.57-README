                                WARNING

        This working version is believed to be stable, but
        we have not run our full regression-test suite.

Summary:

  Bug fixes and minor feature enhancements.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Libraries:
----------

- Replaced stub for Array2.copy with an actual implementation.
- Fixed erroneous out-of-bounds test in *ArraySlice.update.
- Removed deprecated function Substring.all.
- Tweaked the new interval set API (in SML/NJ library) somewhat.
- Renamed Pack<N>{Big,Little} to their correct names
  PackWord<N>{Big,Little}.
- Changed hex digits to upper-case as required by the Basis spec.

Tools:
------

- Fixed problem in back-trace facility where a spurious
  message about exception ExnDuringExecution would be printed.

System:
-------

- Re-organized the way the compiler refers to libraries such as
  the Basis, various components of the SML/NJ library, and the
  ML-Yacc library.
  (It is now possible to redefine the pathname anchors that normally
  are used to refer to these libraries (for the purpose of pointing
  user code to alternative implementations etc.) without disturbing
  the proper functioning of the interactive system and the compiler.)
