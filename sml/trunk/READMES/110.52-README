                                WARNING

        This working version is believed to be stable, but
        we have not run our full regression-test suite.

Summary:

   Minor additions and improvements to library code; bug fixes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Details:

Interactive system:
-------------------

  - improved error messages related to .cm- and .sml-files that
    appear as part of the command line

Basis:
------

  - The system can now (optionally) be compiled with 64-bit position
    values (structure Position = Int64).  See the HISTORY file for
    more information.

Libraries:
----------

  - HashString.hashString' for substrings added.
  - Atom.atom' now extracts a string from the given substring only
    if it is not already in the table.
  - Two simple but potentially useful statistics modules added to
    SML/NJ library.
  - Minor performance improvements.

Compiler/MLRISC:
----------------

  - bug fixes in PPC backend (does not affect SML/NJ directly)

Scripts:
--------

  - fixed bug in ml-makedepend
  - tried to make scripts more robust against filenames that contain
    whitespace (common under Win32 and Mac OS X)
