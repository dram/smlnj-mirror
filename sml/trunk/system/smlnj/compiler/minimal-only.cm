 * This library exists only for administrative reasons because we
 * want to mention "minimal.cm" in "intsys.cm" (so it gets made during
 * bootstrap compilation), but we can't do so because of the name conflict
 * that it would create with $smlnj/compiler.cm.  Therefore, minimal-only.cm
 * does not re-export structure Compiler. *)
