 *
 * This mystery code was derived from the MIT Xlib implementation.  The following
 * description of the keycode to keysym translation is lifted from the X11 protocol
 * definition:
 *
 * A KEYCODE represents a physical (or logical) key.  Keycodes lie in the
 * inclusive range [8,255].  A keycode value carries no intrinsic information,
 * although server implementors may attempt to encode geometry information
 * (for example, matrix) to be interpreted in a server-dependent fashion.  The
 * mapping between keys and keycodes cannot be changed using the protocol.
 * 
 * A KEYSYM is an encoding of a symbol on the cap of a key.  The set of defined
 * KEYSYMs include the character sets Latin 1, Latin 2, Latin 3, Latin 4, Kana,
 * Arabic, Cryllic, Greek, Tech, Special, Publish, APL, and Hebrew as well as a
 * set of symbols common on keyboards (Return, Help, Tab, and so on).  KEYSYMs
 * with the most-significant bit (of the 29 bits) set are reserved as
 * vendor-specific.
 * 
 * A list of KEYSYMs is associated with each KEYCODE.  The list is intended to
 * convey the set of symbols on the corresponding key.  If the list (ignoring
 * trailing NoSymbol entries) is a single KEYSYM ``[K],'' then the list is
 * treated as if it were the list ``[K, NoSymbol, K, NoSymbol].''  If the list
 * (ignoring trailing NoSymbol entries) is a pair of KEYSYMs ``[K1, K2]'',
 * then the list is treated as if it were the list ``[K1, K2, K1, K2]''.  If
 * the list (ignoring trailing NoSymbol entries) is a triple of KEYSYMs
 * ``[K1, K2, K3]'', then the list is treated as if it were the list
 * ``[K1, K2, K3, NoSymbol]''.  When an explicit ``void'' element is desired
 * in the list, the value VoidSymbol can be used.
 * 
 * The first four elements of the list are split into two groups of KEYSYMs.
 * Group 1 contains the first and second KEYSYMs, Group 2 contains third and
 * fourth KEYSYMs.  Within each group, if the second element of the group is
 * NoSymbol, then the group should be treated as if the second element were the
 * same as the first element, except when the first element is an alphabetic
 * KEYSYM ``K'' for which both lowercase and uppercase forms are defined. In
 * that case, the group should be treated as if the first element were the
 * lowercase form of ``K'' and the second element were the uppercase form
 * of ``K''.
 * 
 * The standard rules for obtaining a KEYSYM from a KeyPress event make use of
 * only the Group 1 and Group 2 KEYSYMs; no interpretation of other KEYSYMs in
 * the list is given here.  Which group to use is determined by modifier state.
 * Switching between groups is controlled by the KEYSYM named MODE SWITCH, by
 * attaching that KEYSYM to some KEYCODE and attaching that KEYCODE to any one
 * of the modifiers Mod1 through Mod5.  This modifier is called the ``group
 * modifier''.  For any KEYCODE, Group 1 is used when the group modifier is
 * off, and Group 2 is used when the group modifier is on.
 * 
 * Within a group, which KEYSYM to use is also determined by modifier state.  The
 * first KEYSYM is used when the Shift and Lock modifiers are off.  The second
 * KEYSYM is used when the Shift modifier is on, or when the Lock modifier is on
 * and the second KEYSYM is uppercase alphabetic, or when the Lock modifier is on
 * and is interpreted as ShiftLock.  Otherwise, when the Lock modifier is on and
 * is interpreted as CapsLock, the state of the Shift modifier is applied first
 * to select a KEYSYM, but if that KEYSYM is lowercase alphabetic, then the
 * corresponding uppercase KEYSYM is used instead.
 * 
 * The KEYMASK modifier named Lock is intended to be mapped to either a CapsLock
 * or a ShiftLock key, but which one is left as application-specific and/or
 * user-specific.  However, it is suggested that the determination be made
 * according to the associated KEYSYM(s) of the corresponding KEYCODE.
 *
 * NOTE: XReply.decodeGetKeyboardMappingReply removes trailing NoSymbol entries.
