	* TopLevel/viscomp/control.sig (FLINT.printFctTypes): to reduce clutter.
	(splitThreshold): to control splitting agressiveness.

	* TopLevel/viscomp/control.sml:  moved substructs outside so that clients
	  can refer to them directly (rather than through Control.Foo) to reduce
	  spurious dependencies.

	* TopLevel/main/{codes,compile}: call `split' from flintcomp, not compile.

1999-03-02  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@cs.yale.edu>

	* Semant/pickle/(un)pickmod.sml (fkind): pickle the inline bit.

	* Semant/pickle/pickmod.sml (mkPickleLty):
	  alpha-rename was not applied to NVAR.

	* Semant/pickle/unpickmod.sml (lvar): was improperly defined.
	(tyc): TC_NVAR wasn't read correctly.
	(tfundec): pickle puts a leading "1", so look for a "1", not a "0".

1998-11-12  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@cs.yale.edu>

	* MiscUtil/util/stats.sml: added counters.

1998-11-09  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@cs.yale.edu>

	* TopLevel/viscomp/control.sml
	(checkDatatypes): turned off because of infinite looping problems

1998-11-05  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@cs.yale.edu>

1998-10-27  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@cs.yale.edu>

	* TopLevel/viscomp/control.sml (listLiterals): turned it back off because
	  it increases the resulting heap size by more than 10%.
