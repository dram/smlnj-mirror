(* All kinds of beta-reductions.  In order to do as much work per pass as
 * possible, the usage counts of each variable (maintained by the Collect
 * module) is kept as much uptodate as possible.  For instance as soon as a
 * variable becomes dead, all the variables that were referenced have their
 * usage counts decremented correspondingly.  This means that we have to
 * be careful to make sure that a dead variable will indeed not appear
 * in the output lexp since it might else reference other dead variables *)

(* things that fcontract does:
 * - several things not mentioned
 * - elimination of Con(Decon x)
 * - update counts when selecting a SWITCH alternative
 * - contracting RECORD(R.1,R.2) => R  (only if the type is easily available)
 * - dropping of dead arguments
 *)

(* things that lcontract.sml does that fcontract doesn't do (yet):
 * - inline across DeBruijn depths (will be solved by named-tvar)
 * - elimination of let [dead-vs] = pure in body
 *)

(* things that cpsopt/eta.sml did that fcontract doesn't do:
 * - let f vs = select(v,i,g,g vs)
 *)

(* things that cpsopt/contract.sml did that fcontract doesn't do:
 * - IF-idiom (I still don't know what it is)
 * - unifying branches
 * - Handler operations
 * - primops expressions
 * - branch expressions
 *)

(* things that could also be added:
 * - elimination of dead vars in let
 * - elimination of constant arguments
 *)

(* things that would require some type info:
 * - dropping foo in LET vs = RAISE v IN foo
 *)

(* eta-reduction is tricky:
 * - recognition of eta-redexes and introduction of the corresponding
 *   substitution in the table has to be done at the very beginning of
 *   the processing of the FIX
 * - eta-reduction can turn a known function into an escaping function
 * - fun f (g,v2,v3) = g(g,v2,v3) looks tremendously like an eta-redex
 *)

(* order of contraction is important:
 * - the body of a FIX is contracted before the functions because the
 *   functions might end up being inlined in the body in which case they
 *   could be contracted twice.
 *)

(* When creating substitution f->g (as happens with eta redexes or with
 * code like `LET [f] = RET[g]'), we need to make sure that the usage cout
 * of f gets properly transfered to g.  One way to do that is to make the
 * transfer incremental:  each time we apply the substitution, we decrement
 * f's count and increment g's count.  But this can be tricky since the
 * elimination of the eta-redex (or the trivial binding) eliminates one of the
 * references to g and if this is the only one, we might trigger the killing
 * of g even though its count would be later incremented.  Similarly, inlining
 * of g would be dangerous as long as some references to f exist.
 * So instead we do the transfer once and for all when we see the eta-redex,
 * which frees us from those two problems but forces us to make sure that
 * every existing reference to f will be substituted with g.
 * Also, the transfer of counts from f to g is not quite straightforward
 * since some of the references to f might be from inside g and without doing
 * the transfer incrementally, we can't easily know which of the usage counts
 * of f should be transfered to the internal counts of g and which to the
 * external counts.
 *)

(* Preventing infinite inlining:
 * - inlining a function in its own body amounts to unrolling which has
 *   to be controlled (you only want to unroll some number of times).
 *   It's currently simply not allowed.
 * - inlining a recursive function outside of tis body amounts to `peeling'
 *   one iteration. Here also, since the inlined body will have yet another
 *   call, the inlining risks non-termination.  It's hence also
 *   not allowed.
 * - inlining a mutually recursive function is just a more general form
 *   of the problem above although it can be safe and desirable in some cases.
 *   To be safe, you simply need that one of the functions forming the
 *   mutual-recursion loop cannot be inlined (to break the loop).  This cannot
 *   be trivially checked.  So we (foolishly?) trust the `inline' bit in
 *   those cases.  This is mostly used to inline wrappers inside the
 *   function they wrap.
 * - even if one only allows inlining of funtions showing no sign of
 *   recursion, we can be bitten by a program creating its own Y combinator:
 *       datatype dt = F of dt -> int -> int
 *       let fun f (F g) x = g (F g) x in f (F f) end
 *   To solve this problem, `cexp' has an `ifs' parameter containing the set
 *   of funtions that we are inlining in order to detect (and break) cycles.
 * - funnily enough, if we allow inlining recursive functions the cycle
 *   detection will ensure that the unrolling (or peeling) will only be done
 *   once.  In the future, maybe.
 *)

(* Dropping useless arguments.
 * Arguments whose value is constant (i.e. the function is known and each
 * call site provides the same value for that argument (or the argument
 * itself in the case of recursive calls) can be safely removed and replaced
 * inside the body by a simple let binding.  The only problem is that the
 * constant argument might be out of scope at the function definition site.
 * It is obviously always possible to move the function to bring the argument
 * in scope, but since we don't do any code motion here, we're stuck.
 * If it wasn't for this little problem, we could do the cst-arg removal in
 * collect (we don't gain anything from doing it here).
 * The removal of dead arguments (args not used in the body) on the other
 * hand can quite well be done in collect, the only problem being that it
 * is convenient to do it after the cst-arg removal so that we can rely
 * on deadarg to do the actual removal of the cst-arg.
 *)

(* Simple inlining (inlining called-once functions, which doesn't require
 * alpha-renaming) seems inoffensive enough but is not always desirable.
 * The typical example is wrapper functions introduced by eta-expand: they
 * usually (until inlined) contain the only call to the main function,
 * but inlining the main function in the wrapper defeats the purpose of the
 * wrapper.
 * cpsopt dealt with this problem by adding a `NO_INLINE_INTO' hint to the
 * wrapper function.  In this file, the idea is the following:
 * If you have a function declaration like `let f x = body in exp', first
 * contract `exp' and only contract `body' afterwards.  This ensures that
 * the eta-wrapper gets a chance to be inlined before it is (potentially)
 * eta-reduced away.  Interesting details:
 * - all functions (even the ones that would have a `NO_INLINE_INTO') are
 *   contracted, because the "aggressive usage count maintenance" makes any
 *   alternative painful (the collect phase has already assumed that dead code
 *   will be eliminated, which means that fcontract should at the very least
 *   do the dead-code elimination, so you can only avoid fcontracting a
 *   a function if you can be sure that the body doesn't contain any dead-code,
 *   which is generally  not known).
 * - once a function is fcontracted, its inlinable status is re-examined.
 *   More specifically, if no inlining occured during its fcontraction, then
 *   we assume that the code has just become smaller and should hence
 *   still be considered inlinable.  On another hand, if inlining took place,
 *   then we have to reset the inline-bit because the new body might
 *   be completely different (i.e. much bigger) and inlining it might be
 *   undesirable.
 *   This means that in the case of
 *       let fwrap x = body1 and f y = body2 in exp
 *   if fwrap is fcontracted before f and something gets inlined into it,
 *   then fwrap cannot be inlined in f.
 *   To minimize the impact of this problem, we make sure that we fcontract
 *   inlinable functions only after fcontracting other mutually recursive
 *   functions.  One way to solve the problem more thoroughly would be
 *   to keep the uncontracted fwrap around until f has been contracted.
 *   Such a trick hasn't seemed necessary yet.
 * - at the very end of the optimization phase, cpsopt had a special pass
 *   that ignored the `NO_INLINE_INTO' hint (since at this stage, inlining
 *   into it doesn't have any undesirable side effects any more).  The present
 *   code doesn't need such a thing.  On another hand, the cpsopt approach
 *   had the advantage of keeping the `inline' bit from one contract phase to
 *   the next.  If this ends up being important, one could add a global
 *   "noinline" flag that could be set to true whenever fcontracting an
 *   inlinable function (this would ensure that fcontracting such an inlinable
 *   function can only reduce its size, which would allow keeping the `inline'
 *   bit set after fcontracting).
