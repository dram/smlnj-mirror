(* ltyextern.sig *)

(*
 * This interface hides the implementation details of FLINT tkind, tyc, and 
 * lty defined inside LtyKernel. For each entity, we provide a series of 
 * constructor funtions, deconstructor functions, predicate functions,
 * and other utility functions. We divide these functions into three files:
 * LtyDef contains the set of abstract constructor, deconstructor, and
 * predicate functions for tkind, tyc, and lty; LtyBasic includes all 
 * functions in LtyDef plus all commonly used primitive tycs and ltys, and
 * utility functions; finally, the current LtyExtern structure includes all
 * functions in LtyBasic plus a set of rather specialized utility functions.
 *
 * We design this hierarchy in a way so that LtyDef as a stable interface, 
 * so one can refer to types such as tkind, tyc, lty as LtyDef.tkind, etc;
 * LtyBasic is a medium-stable interface, only commonly used functions 
 * should be left here; LtyExtern is a least-stable interface, any new 
 * utility function that manipulates types should go here.
 *
 * The conventions are (1) types should be referenced as "LtyDef.foo"
 * (2) functions should all be accessed as "LtyExtern.foo". The client
 * in general should never need to access LtyKernel.
 *
 * This interface should only refer to structures such as DebIndex, LtyKernel, 
 * PrimTyc, Symbol, and LtyBasic (indirectly LtyDef).

(*
 * We left the definitions of tkind, tyc, and lty in a separate file, i.e.,
 * ltydef.sig and ltydef.sml. The idea is that those two files should change
 * very rarely while the interface for LtyExtern may change often. The client
 * should refer to LtyDef for the use of type names, and to LtyExtern for the
 * use of utility functions.
