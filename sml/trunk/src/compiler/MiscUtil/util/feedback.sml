(* Input: A directed graph; that is, a list of vertex-numbers, 
            each node with a list of out-edges which indicate other vertices.
   Output:  A minimum feedback vertex set.

   Method: branch and bound

   NOTE:  By setting MAXDEPTH=infinity, this algorithm will produce
         the exact minimum feedback vertex set.  With MAXDEPTH<infinity,
	 the result will still be a feedback vertex set, but not
         always the minimum set.  However, on almost all real programs,
	 MAXDEPTH=3 will give perfect and efficiently computed results.
	 Increasing MAXDEPTH will not make the algorithm take longer or
	 produce better results on "real" programs.
