 * This is library $smlnj/MLRISC/Graphs.cm -- a proxy providing the
 * services of $SMLNJ-MLRISC/Graphs.cm.
 *   The path anchor $SMLNJ-MLRISC points to (implementation of the)
 *   version of MLRISC that is used by SML/NJ.
 *   This proxy takes care of binding path anchors internal to MLRISC
 *   in such a way that they consistently point to the same version
 *   of MLRISC.
