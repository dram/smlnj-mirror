# This is the specification for how to build the "init group".
# The main purpose of the init group is to tie in the runtime system
# and to build the pervasive environment.  The pervasive enviroment
# must contain a binding of the "special" structure named "_Core".
# Because of its special nature, the init group cannot be described as
# an ordinary CM library.  Instead, it is built from the DAG description
# in this file.  The bootstrap compiler turns the init group into an
# ordinary stable group.  The boot process fetches the pervasive
# environment from that stable library.
#
# In addition to the pervasive environments, the init group can (and does)
# also export additional definitions.  These can be accessed by client code
# (such as the implementation of the Basis library) by simply listing
# "init.cmi : cm" in their respective library description files.  (Since CM
# does not automatically recognize the member class of ".cmi" files, the
# class "cm" must be given explicitly.)  Clients who want to access "init.cmi"
# must be in possession of the privilege named "primitive".
#
# The specification is basically a DAG: "bind" statements define
# named environments which are the results of compiling the files on the
# right-hand side of "=" wrt. a combination of the environments given
# in parentheses.
#
# Format of this file:
#  - The file is processed on a line-by-line basis.
#  - Empty lines and lines beginning with "#" are ignored.
#  - Actual whitespace, "=", ",", "(", and ")" are all counted as whitespace.
#     (this means that the syntactic sugar you see below is really just
#      sugar for the human eye; the program that processes this file can
#      do without it)
#  - A line that says "nosplit" disables cross-module inlining (aka
#    "lambda-splitting") until the next line that says "split".
#  - The (single) "rts-placeholder" line acts mostly like a "bind" line.
#    Its purpose is to specify the module that plays the role of a
#    placeholder for the runtime system.
#  - A "bind-core" line acts like a "bind" line, but it has an additional
#    first argument which must be the name of a structure bound at top-level
#    by the named .sml file.  CM replaces these bindings by corresponding
#    bindings of the internal structure symbol "_Core".
#  - "bind" lines (as well as "bind-core" lines and the "rts-placeholder"
#    line) must be in topological order (i.e., they cannot access environment
#    names that are being defined later).
#  - The last line that gets processed is the "return" line.
#    It must specify at least one environment name, namely the one that is
#    used as the system-wide "pervasive" environment.
#    For any additional name n the exports of the module that was bound
#    (by "bind") to n are added to the exports of the init group.
#    These exports can be accessed by clients that explicitly list init.cmi
#    in their own description files.
#    Note: Since some clients need direct access to the core environment,
#    the name "core" is also listed.  This "core" (as opposed to "xcore"
#    has a binding for structure "Core" which can be accessed directly
#    from SML source code.)
#  - There is one pre-defined name ("primitive") that refers to the
#    Environment.primEnv.  It must not be "exported" by the "return" line.
#
# Note that a binding for structure _Core is necessary ALMOST EVERYWHERE.
# Therefore, it is necessary that the pervasive environment has such a
# binding.  For files of this initial group (which do not yet have the
# benefit of being able to access the pervasive environment), a trivial
# member "xcore" is used to supply _Core.

#### END OF EXPLANATION, SPEC STARTS HERE...

# Turn off splitting. It would confuse the compiler because the following
# files are not actually loaded at boot time.
nosplit

# The "signature" of the runtime system.  (No _Core yet.)
bind asig = assembly.sig (primitive)

# The placeholder for the runtime system. (No _Core yet.)
rts-placeholder rts = dummy.sml (asig, primitive)

# We can now turn the cross-module optimizer on (when available)...
split

# This defines the core environment to be used everywhere else...
# (This binds the structure symbol "Core", which is not yet the one that
# is used implicitly by the compiler.  Of course, "core.sml" itself cannot
# yet have access to _Core.)
bind core = core.sml (rts, asig, primitive)

# Now we make the binding for structure _Core for use by the remaining
# members of the init group. (Everybody else in the world gets access to
# _Core via the pervasive env.)
# The "bind-core" line says that its first argument ("xCore") should be
# re-written as "_Core" before compilation. This rewriting is done
# internally after the parser has already completed. Normally, there is
# no way of referring explicitly to a structure named _Core.
bind-core (xCore) xcore = xcore.sml (core)

# The rest of the DAG...
# (Everybody implicitly depends on xcore to have access to _Core.)
bind built-in = built-in.sml (core, primitive, xcore)
bind pp = pre-perv.sml (built-in, xcore)
bind ps = pre-string.sml (core, built-in, pp, xcore)
bind ss-sig = substring.sig (pp, built-in, xcore)
bind ss = substring.sml (ss-sig, pp, ps, core, built-in, xcore)
bind print-hook = print-hook.sml (built-in, xcore)

bind exn-info-hook = exn-info-hook.sml (built-in, xcore)
bind init-utils = init-utils.sml (ps ss-sig ss, xcore)

# Building the "pervasive" environment.  This file should be
# kept as small as possible and only bind non-modular things
# (i.e., top-level types and values).
# Make sure everybody else in the world gets access to structure _Core...
bind-core (xCore) pervasive = pervasive.sml (core, ps, ss, pp, print-hook, use-hook, exn-info-hook, built-in, xcore)

# Report the results to the world...
