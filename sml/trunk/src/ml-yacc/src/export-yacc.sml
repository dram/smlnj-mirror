 * Revision 1.4  2000/06/06 02:14:55  blume
 * merging changes from devel branch; new boot files
 *
 * Revision 1.2.2.1  2000/06/02 08:11:06  blume
 * added several appendices to CM manual;
 * merged recent changes to main trunk into devel branch
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2000/06/01 18:33:44  monnier
 * bring revisions from the vendor branch to the trunk
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2000/03/07 04:01:05  blume
 * - size info in BOOTLIST
 *      * no fixed upper limits for number of bootfiles or length of
 *        bootfile names in runtime
 *      * falling back to old behavior if no BOOTLIST size info found
 * - allocation size heuristics in .run-sml
 *      * tries to read cache size from /proc/cpuinfo (this is important for
 *         small-cache Celeron systems!)
 * - install.sh robustified
 * - CM manual updates
 * - paranoid mode
 *      * no more CMB.deliver() (i.e., all done by CMB.make())
 *      * can re-use existing sml.boot.* files
 *      * init.cmi now treated as library
 *      * library stamps for consistency checks
 * - sml.boot.<arch>-<os>/PIDMAP file
 *      * This file is read by the CM startup code.  This is used to minimize
 *        the amount of dynamic state that needs to be stowed away for the
 *        purpose of sharing between interactive system and user code.
 * - CM.Anchor.anchor instead of CM.Anchor.{set,cancel}
 *      * Upon request by Elsa.  Anchors now controlled by get-set-pair
 *        like most other CM state variables.
 * - Compiler.CMSA eliminated
 *      * No longer supported by CM anyway.
 * - fixed bugs in pickler that kept biting Stefan
 *      * past refs to past refs (was caused by the possibility that
 *        ad-hoc sharing is more discriminating than hash-cons sharing)
 *      * integer overflow on LargeInt.minInt
 * - ml-{lex,yacc} build scripts now use new mechanism
 *   for building standalone programs
 * - fixed several gcc -Wall warnings that were caused by missing header
 *   files, missing initializations, etc., in runtime (not all warnings
 *   eliminated, though)
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.10.4.1  2000/02/20 14:44:34  blume
 * CMB.deliver merged with CMB.make; runtime boot code made more flexible
