short term:
- improve noweb tool (witness files, subdir)
- change ml-yacc tool so that options can be passed independently to
  .sig file and to .sml file
- come up with some version of ml-build that does not produce a new
  heap image if nothing had to be recompiled
- remove unfortunate dependence of SrcPath module on Servers module

long term:
- Try to generalize CM by abstracting from programming language (and compiler),
  so it can work with Twelf, TILT, or things like HOL
- Generic notification architecture (ErrorMsg module, Say module, ...)
- handling of non-generalizability should move to later moment in time
- environment canonicalization
