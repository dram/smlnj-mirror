- Try to generalize CM by abstracting from programming language (and compiler),
  so it can work with Twelf, TILT, or things like HOL
- Generic notification architecture (ErrorMsg module, Say module, ...)
- handling of non-generalizability should move to later moment in time
- lazy environment stubs
- environment canonicalization
