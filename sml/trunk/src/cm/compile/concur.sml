(*
 * A very simple concurrency package (inspired by CML and the concept of
 * "futures", but much less powerful).
 *   - uses no preemption
 *   - thread gives up control by waiting on a condition
 *   - conditions can signal thread termination, available input on some
 *     text stream, or on some explicitly signalled "unit" condition
 *   - gives total priority to "local" computations
 *     (meaning that all threads must get stuck before I/O is even checked)
 * (This is just here to utilize some external concurrency, i.e., OS
 *  processes.  The processes must synchronize themselves with the
 *  controlling process via I/O.)
