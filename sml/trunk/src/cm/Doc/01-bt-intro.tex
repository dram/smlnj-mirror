\section{Introduction}

Compiler and interactive system for Standard ML of New Jersey
(SML/NJ)~\cite{appel91:sml} are for the most part written in Standard
ML~\cite{milner97}.  After the introduction of the new Compilation and
Library Manager (CM)~\cite{blume00:newcm}, the code has been
reorganized in such a way that the SML/NJ system itself works like any
other stand-alone ML program compiled by SML/NJ.

However, there are a few important differences between compiling an
ordinary ML program using CM and (re-)compiling the interactive system
itself.  These differences are handled by a special-purpose version of
the compilation manager: the bootstrap compiler.  The interface to
this bootstrap compiler is {\tt structure CMB}, exported from library
{\tt \$smlnj/cmb.cm}.

This document describes how to use the bootstrap compiler and also
explains what the differences to ordinary ML code are.
