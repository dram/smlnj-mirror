This is substantially new version of the SML/NJ Library.  It is
now organized into a utility library, and a collection of application
libraries; each with its own subdirectory.  Here is a roadmap of
the library structure:

  Directory	Sources File		Description
  -------------------------------------------------
  Util		smlnj-lib.cm		This is the general utility library.

  RegExp	regexp-lib.cm		Regular-expression library.

  PP		pp-lib.cm		Pretty-printing library.

  HTML		html-lib.cm		This library provides parsing and pretty
					printing of HTML (Version 3.2).

  Unix		unix-lib.cm		Unix specific utilities (including
					networking).

  INet		inet-lib.cm		Networking utilities (for both Unix
					and Windows).

  Reactive	reactive-lib.cm		A low-level reactive scripting library.

The first column is the source directory, the second gives the library sources
file alias (to be used in your application's sources.cm file), and the third
column gives a brief description.  Look at the Doc dicrectory and at the README
files in the individual subdirectories for more documentation.
