<h2> Overview </h2>
A compiler front-end has to be propagate information to
the back-end.  An optimization phase may have to leave behind information
at various places of the IR so that other phases can reuse such information.
MLRISC uses the <font color="#ff0000">annotations</font> 
mechanism for these functions.  
Individual instructions, basic blocks, and flow graph edges, 
can be attached one or more annotations.  
<p>
The basic MLRISC system understands the following set of annotations:

<ul>
   <li> <tt>COMMENT</tt> --
         these can be used to attach comments.  If attached to
         an instruction, the assemblers will output 
         them as part of their assembly output.
   <li> <tt>BRANCH_PROB</tt> -- 
          these can be attached to a branch instruction to indicate
          the probability in which is it taken.
   <li> <tt>EXECUTION_FREQ</tt> -- 
          these can be attached to a basic block to indicate the
          frequency in which it is executed.
</ul>
