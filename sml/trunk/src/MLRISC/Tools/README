What's In Here
==============

  This directory contains some tools that I've written for generating
  MLRISC modules from machine descriptions.   They may also be useful 
  for others.


Organization
============

  PP/         --- a combinator based pretty printer


  SourceMap/  --- a simple source location mapping utility

  PrecParser/ --- a very naive precedence parser

  FakeSMLAst/ --- the abstract syntax tree and associated transformation 
                  routines for MDL, which includes a (hopefully complete) 
                  ast for SML.  MDL is MLRISC's machine description language.

  Parser/     --- parser and lexer for the same

  MatchCompiler/ --- a pattern matching compiler library

  RewriteGen/ --- a separate tool for generating rewriters

  nowhere/  --- the source to 'nowhere', a translator that converts
                 SML with where-clauses into SML code.

  ASDL/      --- some utilities for emitting ASDL definitions.
  
  MDL/       --- the source for the MDL -> SML code translator.

  basis.md   --- the standard basis for writing machine descriptions

  mdl.vim    --- vim syntax highlighting file for mdl descriptions.
