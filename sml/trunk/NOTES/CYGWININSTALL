Installation instructions for SML/NJ under Cygwin 
-------------------------------------------------

Note that these instructions have changed as of 110.77.  In prior
releases, the default behavior of config/install.sh on Cygwin was
to build and use the Win32 runtime system.  As of 110.77, the default
behavior is to build and use the Cygwin (i.e., Unix) version of
the runtime.  For the old behavior, one should set the environment
variable SMLNJ_WINDOWS_RUNTIME:

	export SMLNJ_WINDOWS_RUNTIME
	SMLNJ_WINDOWS_RUNTIME=1


Pre-110.77 instructions
-----------------------

1. Choose a directory to install SML/NJ.  Note that currently 
   SML/NJ *must* be installed in a directory mounted in binmode.
   Installation will fail if you try to install it in a directory
   mounted in textmode.  See the manpage for 'mount' for details.

2. Set SMLNJ_CYGWIN_RUNTIME=1 and export the environment variable.
   E.g.,

       SMLNJ_CYGWIN_RUNTIME=1
       export SMLNJ_CYGWIN_RUNTIME

   in Bourne sh and variants.  Or

       setenv SMLNJ_CYGWIN_RUNTIME 1

   in csh and variants.      
    
   When this is set SML/NJ will select the Cygwin runtime instead of
   the default Windows runtime.

3. Simply treat Cygwin as a Unix, and follow the usual installation
   instructions.
