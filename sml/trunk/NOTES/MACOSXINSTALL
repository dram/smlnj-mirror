Installation instructions for SML/NJ under MacOS X
--------------------------------------------------

We now provide a disk image containing an installer package
for SML/NJ.  The package contains a full installation
including nearly all optional components.  (We only
exclude "mlrisc-tools" and "nowhere".)  In the near
future we plan to provide a meta-package which lets
users select the components to be installed.

The current installer lets the user choose an installation
root directory.  The default is /usr/local/smlnj.
The SML/NJ-specific "bin" directory containing the
"sml" command and its siblings is not automatically
added to the shell's search path, though.

When using the installer package (even in the case
when the installation directory is not the default
/usr/local/smlnj) it is NOT necessary to set any
global environment variables such as SMLNJ_HOME.

When developer tools are present on a MacOS X machine,
then it is also always possible to do a generic install
(see file INSTALL).
