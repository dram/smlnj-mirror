Installation instructions for SML/NJ under Cygwin 
-------------------------------------------------

1. Choose a directory to install SML/NJ.  Note that currently 
   SML/NJ *must* be installed in a directory mounted in binmode.
   Installation will fail if you try to install it in a directory
   mounted in textmode.  See the manpage for 'mount' for details.

2. Set SMLNJ_CYGWIN_RUNTIME=1 and export the environment variable.
   E.g.,

       SMLNJ_CYGWIN_RUNTIME=1
       export SMLNJ_CYGWIN_RUNTIME

   in Bourne sh and variants.  Or

       setenv SMLNJ_CYGWIN_RUNTIME 1

   in csh and variants.      
    
   When this is set SML/NJ will select the Cygwin runtime instead of
   the default Windows runtime.

3. Simply treat Cygwin as a Unix, and follow the usual installation
   instructions.
