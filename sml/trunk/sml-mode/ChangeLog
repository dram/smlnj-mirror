1999-06-13  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@cs.yale.edu>

	* sml-smlnj.el, sml-mosml.el, sml-poly-ml.el: removed.

	* sml-proc.el (...): got rid of sml-next-error by spicing up the interface
	  with compile.el so that intervals can be displayed.  `sml-overlay' is
	  kept (and moved from sml-mode to sml-proc where it belongs) but is
	  made redundant in the case of transient-mark-mode.

1999-06-12  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@cs.yale.edu>

	* sml-proc.el (sml-prompt-regexp): more general regexp to catch mosml,
	  smlnj as well as polyml prompts.
	(sml-update-cursor, sml-send-command, inferior-sml-mode): make it work
	  with compile.el's `next-error'.
	(sml-temp-threshold): dropped: always use a temp file.

1999-06-10  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@cs.yale.edu>

	* sml-move.el (sml-op-prec): updated the list of default infix ops based on
	  sml/nj's source files.

1999-06-08  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@cs.yale.edu>

	* sml-proc.el (sml-run): removed dubious code to take care of a supposedly
	  special case in order not to sent "" when args=nil.

1999-06-07  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@cs.yale.edu>

	* sml-mode.el (sml-font-lock-syntactic-keywords): added syntactic
	  fontification for the '   \"' case (exhibited by lexgen.sml).

1999-06-07  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@cs.yale.edu>

	* ALL: the new indentation begins to work.  v3_9_0

1999-05-29  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@cs.yale.edu>

	* sml-defs.el (sml-mode-syntax-table): added ~ of prefix-syntax.

	* sml-mode.el (sml-find-match-indent): (nilp sml-type-of-indent) is only
	  applied if the `let' is alone at the end of the line.
	(sml-type-of-indent): default changed to `nil'.

1999-05-28  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@cs.yale.edu>

	* sml-mode.el (sml-font-lock-keywords): changed _ and ' back to word
	  syntax for font-locking.

1999-05-27  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@cs.yale.edu>

	* sml-mode.el (sml-font-lock-syntactic-keywords): finally got the
	  matching of let...end working.
	  (sml-electric-pipe): take a fun sexp (symbol) rather than a fun word.

1998-10-26  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@cs.yale.edu>

	* sml-mode.el (sml-font-lock-syntactic-keywords): added syntactic-keywords
	  to support nested comments.
