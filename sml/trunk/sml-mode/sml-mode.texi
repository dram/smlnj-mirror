@chapter Introduction

@c == Introduction, SML Mode, Copying, Top =============================


@noindent
SML mode is a major mode for Emacs for editing Standard ML. It has
some novel bugs, and some nice features:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Automatic indentation of sml code---a number of variables to customise
the indentation.
@item
Easy insertion for commonly used templates like let, local, signature,
and structure declarations, with minibuffer prompting for types and
expressions.
@item
Magic pipe insertion: @code{|} automatically determines if it is used
in a case or fun construct, and indents the next line as appropriate, 
inserting @code{=>} or the name of the function.
@item
Inferior shell for running ML. There's no need to leave Emacs, just keep
on editing while the compiler runs in another window.
@item
Automatic ``use file'' in the inferior shell---you can send files,
buffers, or regions of code to the ML subprocess.
@item
Menus, and syntax and keyword highlighting supported for Emacs 19 and
derivatives.
@item
Parsing errors from the inferior shell, and repositioning the
source---much like the next-error function used in c-mode.
@item
SML mode can be easily configured to work with a number of Standard
ML compilers, and other SML based tools.

@c ======================================================== DISTRIBUTION

@node Distribution, Getting Started, Introduction, Introduction

@section The SML mode distribution

@c == Distribution, Getting Started, Introduction, Introduction ========


@noindent
The distribution contains several Emacs Lisp files---this is for ease of
maintenance, you can concatenate them if you're careful:

@table @file
@item sml-mode.el
Main file, and should work in any Emacs editor or version post
18.58---it only knows, or thinks it knows, about SML syntax and
indentation.

@item sml-menus.el
Menus to access user settable features of the mode, and for those who
prefer menus over keys under Emacs 19 and derivatives.

@item sml-@{hilite,font@}.el
Syntax highlighting functions to display keywords in a bold font,
comments in italics, etc., using one of Emacs' two popular syntax
colouring packages.

@item sml-proc.el
Process interaction requires the @file{comint} package (normally
distributed with Emacs 19 and derivatives).

@item sml-@{poly-ml,mosml@}.el
Auxiliary library support for Poly/ML and Moscow ML compilers. 
@c Set these up to autoload from your @file{.emacs}.

@end table

@noindent There is also the Texinfo generated @code{info} file:

@table @file

@item sml-mode.@{dvi,info@}
@c itemx sml-mode.dvi
This file---rudimentary SML mode documentation, and

@item sml-site.el
Configuration file for system-wide installation. Read and edit this file
if you are installing SML mode for general use.

@end table


@c ===================================================== GETTING STARTED

@node Getting Started, Getting Help, Distribution, Introduction

@section Getting started

@c == Getting Started, Getting Help, Distribution, Introduction ========


@noindent
With luck your system administrator will have installed SML mode
somewhere convenient, so all you have to do is put the line

@lisp
(require 'sml-site)
@end lisp

@noindent
in your @file{.emacs} configuration file and all will be well---you can
skip the rest of this getting started section. Otherwise you will need
to tell Emacs where to find all the SML mode @file{.el} files, and
when to use them. The where is addressed by locating the Lisp code on
your Emacs Lisp load path---you may have to create a directory for this,
say @file{/home/mjm/elisp}, and then insert the following lines in your
@file{/home/mjm/.emacs} file@footnote{cf.@: commentary in the site
initialisation file @file{sml-site.el}.}:

@lisp
(setq load-path (cons "/home/mjm/elisp" load-path))
(autoload 'sml-mode "sml-mode" "Major mode for editing SML." t)
@end lisp

@noindent
The first line adjusts Emacs' internal search path so it can locate the
Lisp source you have copied to that directory; the second line tells
Emacs to load the code automatically when it is needed. You can then
switch any Emacs buffer into SML mode by entering the command

@example
M-x sml-mode
@end example

@noindent
It is usually more convenient to have Emacs automatically place the
buffer in SML mode whenever you visit a file containing ML
programs. The simplest way of achieving this is to put something like

@lisp
(setq auto-mode-alist
      (append '(("\\.sml$" . sml-mode) 
                ("\\.sig$" . sml-mode) 
                ("\\.ML$"  . sml-mode)) auto-mode-alist))
@end lisp

@noindent
also in your @file{.emacs} file. Subsequently (after a restart), any
files with these extensions will be placed in SML mode buffers when
you visit them.


You may want to pre-compile the @file{sml-*.el} files (@kbd{M-x
byte-compile-file}) for greater speed---byte compiled code loads and
runs somewhat faster.

@c If you are irritated by the fact that there are several @sc{sml}
@c mode lisp files concatenate them in the order I listed them (but
@c don't include @file{sml-site} which should be kept apart).



@c ======================================================== GETTING HELP

@node Getting Help, , Getting Started, Introduction

@section Help!

@c == Getting Help, , Getting Started, Introduction ====================


@noindent
You're reading it. Apart from the on-line info tree (@kbd{C-h i} is the
Emacs key to enter the @code{info} system---you should follow the brief
tutorial if this is unfamiliar), there are further details on specific
commands in their documentation strings. Only the most useful
SML mode commands are documented in the info tree: to find out more
use Emacs' help facilities.

Briefly, to get help on a specific function use @kbd{C-h f} and enter
the command name. All (almost all, then) SML mode commands begin
with @code{sml-}, so if you type this and press @key{TAB} (for
completion) you will get a list of all commands. Another way is to use
@kbd{C-h a} and enter the string @code{sml}. This is command apropos; it
will list all commands with that sub-string in their names, and any key
binding they may have in the current buffer. Command apropos gives a
one-line synopsis of what each command does.

Some commands are also variables---such things are allowed in Lisp, if
not in ML! @xref{Command Index}, for a list of (info) documented
functions. @xref{Variable Index}, for a list of user settable variables
to control the behaviour of SML mode.

Before accessing this information on-line from within Emacs you may have
to set the variable @code{sml-mode-info}. Put in your @file{.emacs} file
something like:

@vindex sml-mode-info
@findex sml-mode-info
@kindex @kbd{C-c C-i}
@lisp
(setq sml-mode-info "/home/mjm/info/sml-mode.info")
@end lisp

@noindent
When different from the default this variable should be a string giving
the absolute name of the @file{.info} file. Then @kbd{C-c C-i} in
SML mode (i.e., the command @kbd{M-x sml-mode-info}) will bring up
the manual. This help is also accessible from the menu. (Resetting this
variable will not be necessary if your site administrator has been kind
enough to install SML mode and its attendant documentation in the
Emacs hierarchy.)

@c == SML Mode, Interaction Mode, Introduction, Top ====================


@noindent
Now SML mode provides just a few additional editing commands. Most
of the work (@pxref{Credits,,Credit & Blame}) has gone into implementing
the indentation algorithm which, if you think about it, has to be
complicated for a language like ML. @xref{SML Mode Defaults,,Indentation
Defaults}, for details on how to control some of the behaviour of the
indentation algorithm. Principal goodies are the `electric pipe'
feature, and the ability to insert common SML forms (macros or
templates).

@end menu


@c ============================================================== BASICS

@node Basics, Indentation, SML Mode, SML Mode

@section On entering SML mode

@c == Basics, Indentation, SML Mode, SML Mode ==========================

@noindent


@deffn Command sml-mode
This switches a buffer into SML mode. This is a @emph{major mode} in
Emacs. To get out of SML mode the buffer's major mode must be set to
something else, like @t{text-mode}. @xref{Getting Started}, for details
on how to set this up automatically when visiting an SML file.
@end deffn

Emacs is all hooks of course. A hook is a variable: if the variable is
non-nil it binds a list of Emacs Lisp functions to be run in some order
(usually left to right). You can customise SML mode with these
hooks:


@defvr Hook sml-mode-hook
Default: @code{nil}

This is run every time a new SML mode buffer is created (or if you
type @kbd{M-x sml-mode}). This is one place to put your preferred key
bindings. @xref{Configuration}, for some examples.
@end defvr


@defvr Hook sml-load-hook
Default: @code{'sml-mode-version}

Another, maybe better, place for key bindings. This hook is only run when
SML mode is loaded into Emacs. @xref{Configuration}.
@end defvr


@deffn Command sml-mode-version
Prints the current version of SML mode in the mini-buffer, in case
you need to know. I've put it on @code{sml-load-hook} so you can easily
tell which version of SML mode you are running.
@end deffn



@c ========================================================= INDENTATION

@node Indentation, Magic Insertion, Basics, SML Mode

@section Automatic indentation

@c == Indentation, Magic Insertion, Basics, SML Mode ===================


@noindent
ML is a complicated language to parse, let alone compile. The
indentation algorithm is a little wooden (for some tastes), and the best
advice is not to fight it! There are several variables that can be
adjusted to control the indentation algorithm (@pxref{SML Mode
Defaults,,Customising SML Mode}, below).


@deffn Command sml-indent-line
Key: @key{TAB}
@kindex @key{TAB}

This command indents the current line. If you set the indentation of the
previous line by hand, @code{sml-indent-line} will indent relative to
this setting.
@end deffn


@deffn Command sml-indent-region
Key: @kbd{C-M-\}
@kindex @kbd{C-M-\}

Indent the current region. Be patient if the region is large (like the
whole buffer).
@end deffn


@deffn Command sml-back-to-outer-indent
Key: @kbd{M-@key{TAB}}
@kindex @kbd{M-@key{TAB}}

Unindents the line to the next outer level of indentation.
@end deffn



Further indentation commands that Emacs provides (generically, for all
modes) that you may like to recall:

@itemize @minus
@item
@kbd{M-x newline-and-indent}

On @key{LFD} by default.
@kindex @key{LFD}
Insert a newline, then indent according to the major mode. @xref{Program
Indent,,Indentation for Programs,emacs,The Emacs Editor Manual}, for
details.

@item
@kbd{M-x indent-rigidly}

On @kbd{C-x @key{TAB}} by default.
@kindex @kbd{C-x @key{TAB}}
Moves all lines in the region right by its argument (left, for negative
arguments). @xref{Indentation,,,emacs,The Emacs Editor Manual}.

@item
@kbd{M-x indent-for-comment} 

On @kbd{M-;} by default.
@kindex @kbd{M-;}
Indent this line's comment to comment column, or insert an empty
comment. @xref{Comment Commands,,,emacs,The Emacs Editor
Manual}.

@item
@kbd{M-x indent-new-comment-line}

On @kbd{M-@key{LFD}} by default.
@kindex @kbd{M-@key{LFD}}
Break line at point and indent, continuing comment if within one.
@xref{Multi-Line Comments,,,emacs,The Emacs Editor Manual}.
@end itemize

@kindex @kbd{C-x ;}
As with other language modes, @kbd{M-;} gives you a comment at the end
of the current line. The column where the comment starts is determined
by the variable @code{comment-column}---default is 40, but it can be
changed with @code{set-comment-column} (on @kbd{C-x ;} by default).


@c ===================================================== MAGIC INSERTION

@node Magic Insertion, SML Mode Defaults, Indentation, SML Mode

@section Electric features

@c == Magic Insertion, SML Mode Defaults, Indentation, SML Mode ========


@noindent
Electric keys are generally pretty irritating, so those provided by
SML mode are fairly muted. The only truly electric key is @kbd{;},
and this has to be enabled to take effect.


@deffn Command sml-electric-pipe
Key: @kbd{M-|}
@kindex @kbd{M-|}

When the point is in a `case' statement this opens a new line, indents
and inserts @code{| =>} leaving point just before the double arrow; if
the enclosing construct is a `fun' declaration, the newline is indented
and the function name copied at the appropriate column. Generally, try
it whenever a @code{|} is wanted---you'll like it!
@end deffn


@deffn Command sml-electric-semi
Key: @kbd{;}
@kindex @kbd{;}

Just inserts a semi-colon, usually. The behaviour of this command is
governed by the variable @code{sml-electric-semi-mode}.
@end deffn


@defvr {Command, Variable} sml-electric-semi-mode
Default: @code{nil}

If this variable is @code{nil}, @code{sml-electric-semi} just inserts a
semi-colon, otherwise it inserts a semi-colon and a newline, and indents
the newline for SML. The command toggles the value of the variable; if
you give the command a prefix argument (i.e., @kbd{C-u M-x
sml-electric-semi-mode}) this always disables the electric effect of
@kbd{;}.
@end defvr


@deffn Command sml-insert-form
Key: @kbd{C-c @key{RET}}
@kindex @kbd{C-c @key{RET}}

Interactive short-cut to insert common ML forms (a.k.a.@: macros, or
templates). Recognised forms are `let', `local', `case', `abstype',
`datatype', `signature', `structure', and `functor'. Except for `let'
and `local', these will prompt for appropriate parameters like functor
name and signature, etc.. This command prompts in the mini-buffer, with
completion.

By default @kbd{C-c @key{RET}} will insert at point, with the
indentation of the current column; if you give a prefix argument (i.e.,
@kbd{C-u C-c @key{RET}}) the command will insert a newline first,
indent, and then insert the template.
@end deffn

@code{sml-insert-form} is also extensible: see @ref{Configuration} for
further details.



@c ======================================================= MODE DEFAULTS

@node SML Mode Defaults, , Magic Insertion, SML Mode

@section Indentation defaults

@c == SML Mode Defaults, , Magic Insertion, SML Mode ===================


@noindent
Several variables try to control the indentation algorithm and other
features of SML mode. For these user settable variables there is
generally a function of the same name that does the job---look for them
in the menu under @emph{Format/Mode Variables}.


@defvr {Command, Variable} sml-indent-level
@findex sml-indent-level
Default: @code{4}

This variable controls the block indentation level. The command prompts
for a numeric value unless a numeric prefix is provided instead. For
example @kbd{M-2 M-x sml-indent-level} will set the variable to 2
without prompting.
@end defvr


@defvr {Command, Variable} sml-pipe-indent
@findex sml-pipe-indent
Default: @code{-2}

This variable adjusts the indentation level for lines that begin with a
@code{|} (after any white space). The extra offset is usually negative.
The command prompts for a numeric value unless a numeric prefix is
provided instead.
@end defvr


@defvar sml-paren-lookback
Default: @code{1000}

The number of characters the indentation algorithm searches for an
opening parenthesis. 1000 characters is about 30-40 lines; larger values
mean slower indentation. If the value of the variable is @code{nil} this
means the indentation algorithm won't look back at all.
@end defvar


If the default values are not acceptable you can set these variables
permanently in your @file{.emacs} file. @xref{Configuration}, for
details and examples. Three further variables control the behaviour of
indentation.


@defvr {Command, Variable} sml-case-indent
@findex sml-case-indent
Default: @code{nil}

How to indent `case' expressions:

@iftex
@example
@r{If @code{t}:}                                 @r{If @code{nil}:}
case expr                           case expr of
  of exp1 => ...                        exp1 => ...
   | exp2 => ...                      | exp2 => ...
@end example
@end iftex
@ifinfo
@example
If @code{t}:                             If @code{nil}:
case expr                           case expr of
  of exp1 => ...                        exp1 => ...
   | exp2 => ...                      | exp2 => ...
@end example
@end ifinfo

The first seems to be the standard in SML/NJ. The second is the (nicer?)
default.
@end defvr


@defvr {Command, Variable} sml-nested-if-indent
@findex sml-nested-if-indent
Default: @code{nil}

Nested `if-then-else' expressions have the following indentation
depending on the value.

@iftex
@example
@r{If @code{t}:}                               @r{If @code{nil}:}
if exp1 then exp2                 if exp1 then exp2          
else if exp3 then exp4            else if exp3 then exp4     
else if exp5 then exp6                 else if exp5 then exp6
     else exp7                              else exp7       
@end example
@end iftex
@ifinfo
@example
If @code{t}:                           If @code{nil}:
if exp1 then exp2                 if exp1 then exp2          
else if exp3 then exp4            else if exp3 then exp4     
else if exp5 then exp6                 else if exp5 then exp6
     else exp7                              else exp7       
@end example
@end ifinfo
@end defvr


@defvr {Command, Variable} sml-type-of-indent
@findex sml-type-of-indent
Default: @code{t}

Determines how to indent `let', `struct', etc..

@iftex
@example
@r{If @code{t}:}                               @r{If @code{nil}:}
fun foo bar = let                 fun foo bar = let
                  val p = 4           val p = 4    
              in                  in               
                  bar + p             bar + p      
              end                 end              
@end example
@end iftex
@ifinfo
@example
If @code{t}:                           If @code{nil}:
fun foo bar = let                 fun foo bar = let
                  val p = 4           val p = 4    
              in                  in               
                  bar + p             bar + p      
              end                 end              
@end example

@c ========================================================= INTERACTION

@node Interaction Mode, Configuration, SML Mode, Top

@chapter Running ML under Emacs

@c == Interaction Mode, Configuration, SML Mode, Top ===================


@noindent
The most useful feature of SML mode is that it provides a convenient
interface to the compiler. How serious users of ML put up with a
teletype interface to the compiler is beyond me@.@.@. but perhaps there
are other interfaces to compilers that require one to part with serious
money. Such remarks can quickly become dated---in this case, let's hope
so!

Anyway, SML mode provides an interaction mode,
@code{inferior-sml-mode}, where the compiler runs in a separate buffer
in a window or frame of its own. You can use this buffer just like a
terminal, but it's usually more convenient to mark some text in the
SML mode buffer and have Emacs communicate with the sub-process. The
features discussed below are syntax-independent, so they should work
with a wide range of ML-like tools and compilers. @xref{Process
Defaults}, for some hints.

@findex inferior-sml-mode
@code{inferior-sml-mode} is a specialisation of the @file{comint}

@c ========================================================== RUNNING ML

@node Running ML, ML Interaction, Interaction Mode, Interaction Mode

@section Starting the compiler

@c == Running ML, ML Interaction, Interaction Mode, Interaction Mode ==

@noindent
Start your favourite ML compiler with the command

@example
@kbd{M-x run-sml}
@end example

@noindent
This creates a process interaction buffer that inherits some key
bindings from SML mode and from @file{comint} (@pxref{Shell Mode, ,
, emacs, The Emacs Editor Manual}). Starting the ML compiler adds some
functions to SML mode buffers so that program text can be
communicated between editor and compiler (@pxref{ML Interaction}).

The name of the ML compiler is the first thing you should know how to
specify:


@defvar sml-program-name
Default: @code{"sml"}

The program to run as ML. You might need to specify the full path name
of the program.
@end defvar


@defvar sml-default-arg
Default: @code{""}

Useful for Poly/ML users who may supply a database file, or others who
have wrappers for setting various options around the command to run the
compiler. Moscow ML people might set this to @code{"-P full"}, etc..
@end defvar

The variable @code{sml-program-name} is a string holding the name
of the program @emph{as you would type it at the shell}. You 
can always choose a program different to the default by invoking

@example
@kbd{C-u M-x run-sml}
@end example

@noindent
With the prefix argument Emacs will prompt for the command name and any
command line arguments to pass to the compiler. Thereafter Emacs will
use this new name as the default, but for a permanent change you should
set this in your @file{.emacs} with, e.g.:

@lisp
(setq sml-program-name "nj-sml")
@end lisp

@noindent
You probably shouldn't set this in @code{sml-mode-hook} because that
will interfere if you occasionally run a different compiler (e.g.,
@code{poly} or @code{hol90}).



@deffn Command run-sml
Launches ML as an inferior process in another buffer; if an ML process
already exists, just switch to the process buffer. A prefix argument
allows you to edit the command line to specify the program, and any
command line options.
@end deffn


@defvr Hook inferior-sml-mode-hook
Default: @code{nil}

@kbd{M-x run-sml} runs @code{comint-mode-hook} and
@code{inferior-sml-mode-hook} hooks in that order, but @emph{after} the
compiler is started. Use @code{inferior-sml-mode-hook} to set any
@code{comint} buffer-local configurations for SML mode you like.
@end defvr


@defvr Hook inferior-sml-load-hook
Default: @code{nil}

This hook is analogous to @code{sml-load-hook} and is run just after the
code for @code{inferior-sml-mode} is loaded into Emacs. Use this to set
process defaults, and preferred key bindings for the interaction buffer.
@end defvr


@deffn Command switch-to-sml
Key: @kbd{C-c C-s}
@kindex @kbd{C-c C-s}

Switch from the SML buffer to the interaction buffer. By default point
will be placed at the end of the process buffer, but a prefix argument
will leave point wherever it was before. If you try @kbd{C-c C-s} before
an ML process has been started, you'll just get an error message to the
effect that there's no current process buffer.
@end deffn


@deffn Command sml-cd
When started, the ML compiler's default working directory is the
current buffer's default directory. This command allows the working
directory to be changed, if the compiler can do this. The variable
@code{sml-cd-command} specifies the compiler command to invoke
(@pxref{Process Defaults}).
@end deffn



@c @findex inferior-sml-mode
@c It's unlikely you will ever need this, but @code{inferior-sml-mode} is
@c the command that will put the current buffer into ML interaction mode.
@c Note that if you try @kbd{C-c C-s} before an ML process has been
@c started, you'll just get an error message to the effect that there's no
@c current process buffer.



@c ======================================================== SENDING TEXT

@node ML Interaction, Tracking Errors, Running ML, Interaction Mode

@section Speaking to the compiler

@c == ML Interaction, Tracking Errors, Running ML, Interaction Mode ====


@noindent
Several commands are defined for sending program fragments to the
running compiler. Each of the following commands takes a prefix argument
that will switch the input focus to the process buffer afterwards
(leaving point at the end of the buffer):


@deffn Command sml-load-file
Key: @kbd{C-c C-l}
@kindex @kbd{C-c C-l}

Send a `use file' command to the current ML process. The variable
@code{sml-use-command} is used to define the correct template for the
command to invoke (@pxref{Process Defaults}). The default file is the
file associated with the current buffer, or the last file loaded if you
are in the interaction buffer.
@end deffn



@deffn Command sml-send-region
@findex sml-send-region-and-go
Key: @kbd{C-c C-r}
@kindex @kbd{C-c C-r}

Send the current region of text in the SML buffer.
@code{sml-send-region-and-go} is a similar command for you to bind in
SML mode if you wish: it'll send the region and then switch-to-sml.
@end deffn

@deffn Command sml-drag-region
Key: @kbd{M-S-down-mouse-1}
@kindex @kbd{M-S-down-mouse-1}

It's sometimes irritating to do all that @kbd{C-@@} and @kbd{C-c C-r}
stuff to send regions to the ML process, so if you are running Emacs
under X Windows (say) you can do the same job by holding down both the
@key{SHIFT} and @key{META} keys, and dragging with mouse button one over
the region. This will temporarily highlight the region as you move the
mouse, like @code{mouse-drag-region} (i.e., @kbd{down-mouse-1}),
and send the highlighted text straight into the jaws of the ML compiler.

If you only click the mouse button, instead of dragging, the region of
text sent to the compiler is delimited by the current position of point
and the place where you click the mouse. In neither case will the
command set the region.
@end deffn

@c @deffn Command sml-send-function
@c @findex sml-send-function-and-go

@c Send the enclosing `function' definition. Contrary to the suggestive
@c name, this command @emph{does not} try to determine the extent of the
@c function definition because that is too difficult with ML. Instead
@c this just sends the enclosing @emph{paragraph} (delimited by blank
@c lines or form-feed characters).
@c @end deffn

@deffn Command sml-send-buffer
Key: @kbd{C-c C-b}
@kindex @kbd{C-c C-b}

Send the contents of the current buffer to ML.
@end deffn

@c Two further commands are defined for you to bind to keys if you wish:
@c @code{sml-send-region-and-go} and @code{sml-send-function-and-go}. Both
@c automatically switch to the interaction buffer.


By and large, Emacs can nowadays quite happily send large chunks of text
to its subprocesses (@file{comint} does input splitting). However, it is
still probably safest@footnote{XEmacs 19.11 users are warned that
changing the default @code{sml-temp-threshold} may well cause XEmacs to
hang; they seem to have fixed the problem in 19.12 and above.} to send
larger program fragments to ML via the temporary file mechanism. This,
for @code{sml-send-region} and other SML mode commands that use it
in some way, takes advantage of the ML compiler's ability to open a file
and compile the contents by making a temporary file of the indicated
text. Two variables of interest are:


@defvar sml-temp-threshold 
Default: @code{0}

Determines what constitutes a large program fragment. A value of 512,
say, will declare half a kilobyte a suitable threshold and larger
fragments will be sent via a temporary file. A value of 0 means
@emph{all} text is sent via a temporary file; the value @code{nil}
inhibits the temporary file mechanism altogether.
@end defvar


@defvar sml-temp-file 
Default: @code{(make-temp-name "/tmp/ml")}

A string that gives the name of the temporary file to use. This
default ensures Emacs will invent a unique name for this purpose for
use throughout the rest of the editing session. Only one temporary
file is used. 
@end defvar


Another reason, you might well say @emph{the reason}, for using the
temporary file mechanism is that error messages reported by the ML
compiler (@pxref{Tracking Errors}) are generally useless to SML mode
unless a real file is associated with the input (an embedded @emph{use
file} will count as a real file). Of course, this all rather depends on
the compiler producing sensible error messages, and on SML mode
being able to parse them.


@c ===================================================== TRACKING ERRORS

@node Tracking Errors, Process Defaults, ML Interaction, Interaction Mode

@section Finding errors

@c == Tracking Errors, Process Defaults, ML Interaction, Interaction Mode


@noindent
SML mode provides one customisable function for locating the source
position of errors reported by the compiler. This should work whether
you type @code{use "puzzle.sml";} into the interaction buffer, or use
one of the mechanisms provided for sending programs directly to the
compiler---@pxref{ML Interaction}.


@deffn Command sml-next-error
@findex sml-skip-errors
Key: @kbd{C-c`}
@kindex @kbd{C-c`}

Jump to the source location of the next error reported by the compiler.
If the function bound to @code{sml-error-parser} returns a range of
character positions for the location of the error in the source file,
@code{sml-next-error} will put the mark at the end of the range with
point at the beginning; it may also highlight the region specified; it
will also echo the one-line text of the error message if the error
parser returns one.@footnote{Does @code{sml-error-parser} return these
nice things? The answer is complicated! @xref{Advanced Topics}, and the
docstring @kbd{C-h v sml-error-parser}.}

If you enter @kbd{C-u C-c`} instead, the command (a.k.a.@:
@code{sml-skip-errors}) skips past all the remaining error messages and
removes any error overlay in the current buffer. Note that @kbd{C-c`}
also works in the ML interaction buffer (by default).
@end deffn


@defvr {Variable, Command} sml-error-overlay
@findex sml-error-overlay
Default: @code{t}

Legal default values for this buffer-local variable are @code{t} and
@code{nil}. The variable attains a local value in each SML mode
buffer when the default is @code{t}; in this case the local value is an
overlay (or @emph{extent} in XEmacs speak), and this means
@code{sml-next-error} will highlight errors in the buffer when it can.
If the default is @code{nil} it stays that way and @code{sml-next-error}
will not highlight anything, ever.

The command @kbd{M-x sml-error-overlay} will set the overlay around the
current region, or remove the overlay if a prefix argument is given
(i.e., @kbd{C-u M-x sml-error-overlay} removes the overlay, but this
functionality can be accessed from the menu to save typing).
@end defvr


Note that SML mode will usually locate errors relative to the start
of the last major program fragment sent to the compiler (via
@code{sml-load-file}, etc.), but if you don't use the temporary file
mechanism to communicate text to the ML process (@pxref{Process
Defaults}), errors will generally not be located at all.


@c ==================================================== PROCESS DEFAULTS

@node Process Defaults, , Tracking Errors, Interaction Mode

@section Process defaults

@c == Process Defaults, , Tracking Errors, Interaction Mode ============

@noindent
The process interaction code is independent of the compiler used,
deliberately, so SML mode will work with a variety of ML compilers
and ML-based tools. There are therefore a number of variables that may
need to be set correctly before SML mode can speak to the compiler.
Things are by default set up for Standard ML of New Jersey, but
switching to a new system is quite easy---very easy if you are using
Poly/ML or Moscow ML as these are supported by libraries bundled with
SML mode.



@defvar sml-use-command
Default: @code{"use \"%s\""}

Use file command template. Emacs will replace the @code{%s} with a file
name. Note that Emacs requires double quote characters inside strings
to be quoted with a backslash.
@end defvar


@defvar sml-cd-command
Default: @code{"OS.FileSys.chDir \"%s\""}

Compiler command to change the working directory. Not all ML systems
support this feature (well, Edinburgh (core) ML didn't), but they
should.
@end defvar


@defvar sml-prompt-regexp
Default: @code{"^[\-=] *"}

Matches the ML compiler's prompt: @file{comint} uses this for various
purposes.
@end defvar


To customise error reportage for different ML compilers you need to set
two further variables before @code{sml-next-error} can be useful:


@defvar sml-error-regexp
Default: @code{sml-smlnj-error-regexp}

This is the regular expression for matching the start of an error
message. The default matches the Standard ML of New Jersey compiler's
Error and Warning messages. If you don't want stop at Warnings try, for
example:
@example
  "^[-= ]*.+:[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+.+Error:"
@end example
If you're using Edinburgh (core) ML try @code{"^Parse error:"}.
@end defvar


@defvar sml-error-parser 
Default: @code{'sml-smlnj-error-parser}

The function that actually parses the error message. Again, the default
is for SML/NJ. If you need to change this you may have to do a little
Emacs Lisp programming.
@end defvar


Note that bundled libraries supply an @code{sml-mosml-error-parser} and
an @code{sml-poly-ml-error-parser}, and set all the attendant compiler
variables. @xref{Advanced Topics}, for tips on how to program your own
compiler extension to SML mode.


@c A typical way of (re)setting these variables correctly is to put
@c something in your @file{.emacs} file that resembles

@c @example
@c (setq sml-use-command "PolyML.use \"%s\"")
@c (setq sml-prompt-regexp "^[>#] *")
@c @end example

@c @noindent
@c probably on @code{inferior-sml-load-hook} (but @pxref{Configuration},
@c first).


@c ======================================================= CONFIGURATION

@node Configuration, Credits, Interaction Mode, Top

@chapter Configuration Summary

@c == Configuration, Credits, Interaction Mode, Top ===================

@c @footnote{@url{http://www.ahl.co.uk/}}
@c @footnote{@url{http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~sestoft/mosml.html}}

@noindent
This (sort of pedagogic) section gives more information on how to
configure SML mode: menus, key bindings, hooks and highlighting are
discussed, along with a few other random topics. First, though, the
auxiliary files @file{sml-poly-ml.el} and @file{sml-mosml.el} define
defaults for these popular (?) ML compilers---Poly/ML and Moscow ML,
respectively. One way to setup SML mode to use Moscow ML is to add
to your @file{.emacs}:

@example
(defun my-mosml-setup () "Initialise inferior SML mode for Moscow ML."
  (load-library "sml-mosml.el")
  (setq sml-program-name "/home/mjm/mosml/bin/mosml"))
(add-hook 'inferior-sml-load-hook 'my-mosml-setup)
@end example

@noindent 
which creates a hook function @code{my-mosml-setup} and adds it to
@code{inferior-sml-load-hook} so that the defaults for
@code{sml-error-regexp} and its ilk (@pxref{Process Defaults}) are
correctly initialised; I have to set @code{sml-program-name} explicitly
here because that directory isn't on my (Unix) PATH. The story is
similar if you use Poly/ML.
Note, by the way, that order matters here: the @code{load-library} call
comes first because the default for @code{sml-program-name} in
@file{sml-mosml.el} is just @code{"mosml"}. 

@c @example
@c (eval-after-load "sml-proc" '(my-mosml-setup))
@c @end example
@c @noindent
@c is perhaps a better way to achieve the same effect, but last time I
@c looked this wouldn't work in XEmacs.

The auxiliary libraries bundled with SML mode define commands
@code{sml-mosml} and @code{sml-poly-ml} (there's also an
@code{sml-smlnj} for uniformity); these commands prompt for suitable
values for @code{sml-program-name} and @code{sml-default-arg} before
starting the compiler and setting the other process defaults. A prefix
argument will give you the builtin defaults with no questions asked.

@c =============================================================== HOOKS

@node Hooks, Key Bindings, Configuration, Configuration

@section Hooks

@c == Hooks, Key Bindings, Configuration, Configuration ================


@noindent
One way to set SML mode variables (@pxref{SML Mode
Defaults,,Indentation Defaults}), and other defaults, is through the
@code{sml-mode-hook} in your @file{.emacs}. A simple example:

@lisp
(defun my-sml-mode-hook () "Local defaults for SML mode"
  (setq sml-indent-level 2)        ; conserve on horizontal space
  (setq words-include-escape t)    ; \ loses word break status
  (setq indent-tabs-mode nil))     ; never ever indent with tabs
(add-hook 'sml-mode-hook 'my-sml-mode-hook)
@end lisp
@noindent
The body of @code{my-sml-mode-hook} is a sequence of bindings. In this
case it is not really necessary to set @code{sml-indent-level} in a hook
because this variable is global (most SML mode variables are). With
similar effect:

@lisp
(setq sml-indent-level 2)
@end lisp
@noindent
anywhere in your @file{.emacs} file (but probably on
@code{sml-load-hook}). The variable @code{indent-tabs-mode} is
automatically made local to the current buffer whenever it is set
explicitly, so it @emph{must} be set in a hook if you always want
SML mode to behave like this. The same goes for the buffer-local
@code{sml-error-overlay}; since this is globally @code{t} by default,
set it globally @code{nil} if you never want errors highlighted:

@lisp
(setq-default sml-error-overlay nil)
@end lisp
@noindent
Again, on @code{sml-load-hook} would probably be the best place.


Another hook is @code{inferior-sml-mode-hook}. This can be used to
control the behaviour of the interaction buffer through various
variables meaningful to @file{comint}-based packages:

@lisp
(defun my-inf-sml-mode-hook () "Local defaults for inferior SML mode"
  (add-hook 'comint-output-filter-functions 'comint-truncate-buffer)
  (setq      comint-scroll-show-maximum-output t)
  (setq      comint-input-autoexpand nil))
(add-hook 'inferior-sml-mode-hook 'my-inf-sml-mode-hook)
@end lisp
@noindent
Again, the body is a sequence of bindings. Unless you run several ML
compilers simultaneously under one Emacs, this hook will normally only
get run once. You might want to look up the documentation (@kbd{C-h v}
and @kbd{C-h f}) for these buffer-local @code{comint} things.


@c ======================================================== Key Bindings

@node Key Bindings, Menus, Hooks, Configuration

@section Key bindings

@c == Key Bindings, Menus, Hooks, Configuration ========================


@noindent
Customisation (in Emacs) usually entails putting favourite commands on
easily remembered keys. Two `keymaps' are defined in SML mode: one
is effective in program text buffers (@code{sml-mode-map}) and the other
is effective in interaction buffers (@code{inferior-sml-mode-map}).
The initial design ensures that (many of) the default key bindings from
the former keymap will also be available in the latter (e.g.,
@kbd{C-c`}).

Type @kbd{C-h m} in an SML mode buffer to find the default key
bindings (and similarly in an ML interaction buffer), and use the hooks
provided to install your preferred key bindings. Given that the keymaps
are global (variables):

@lisp
(defun my-sml-load-hook () "Global defaults for SML mode"
  (define-key   sml-mode-map "\C-cd" 'sml-cd)
  (define-key   sml-mode-map "\C-co" 'sml-error-overlay))
(add-hook 'sml-load-hook 'my-sml-load-hook)
@end lisp
@noindent
This has the effect of binding @code{sml-cd} to the key @kbd{C-c d}, and
the command @code{sml-error-overlay} to the key @kbd{C-c o}. If you want
the same behaviour from @kbd{C-c d} in the ML buffer:

@lisp
(defun my-inf-sml-load-hook () "Global defaults for inferior SML mode"
  (define-key inferior-sml-mode-map "\C-cd" 'sml-cd)
  ;; NB. for SML/NJ '96
  (setq sml-cd-command "OS.FileSys.chDir \"%s\""))
(add-hook 'inferior-sml-load-hook 'my-inf-sml-load-hook)
@end lisp

There is nothing to stop you rebuilding the entire keymap for
SML mode and the ML interaction buffer in your @file{.emacs} of
course: SML mode won't define @code{sml-mode-map} or
@code{inferior-sml-mode-map} if you have already done so. 


@c =============================================================== Menus

@node Menus, Highlighting, Key Bindings, Configuration

@section Menus

@c == Menus, Highlighting, Key Bindings, Configuration =================


@noindent
Menus are useful for fiddling with mode defaults and finding out what
keys commands are on if you are forgetful (not all commands are listed
in the menu). For menus to appear in the menu bar under GNU Emacs or GNU
XEmacs, the editor must be able to find one of two packages---i.e., one
or both must be on your @code{load-path}. The first option is
@file{easymenu} which is distributed with GNU Emacs. Easy!

The second option is @file{auc-menu} which was written by Per Abrahamsen
and distributed with AUCTeX, but it is independently available from the
IESD lisp archive@footnote{@url{ftp://sunsite.auc.dk/packages/auctex/}}
at Aalborg. You'll also find @file{auc-menu} is available from the LCD
archive@footnote{@url{ftp://archive.cis.ohio-state.edu/pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive/misc/}},
the main repository for all Emacs Lisp. The advantage of @file{auc-menu}
is that it works with XEmacs too.

Notice that certain menu entries are not illuminated at first---these
are generally functions that depend on there being an ML process running
with which to communicate.


@c ======================================================== Highlighting

@node Highlighting, Advanced Topics, Menus, Configuration

@section Syntax colouring

@c == Highlighting, Advanced Topics, Menus, Configuration ==============


@noindent
Highlighting is very handy for picking out keywords in the program text,
spotting misspelled kewyords, and, if you have Emacs' @file{ps-print}
package installed (you usually do these days), obtaining pretty, even
colourful code listings---quite properly for your colourful ML programs.

@vindex sml-font-lock-extra-keywords
@vindex sml-font-lock-auto-on

Various highlight (hilite, if you spell real bad!) packages are
available for GNU Emacs 19, and GNU XEmacs. SML mode can use either
@file{hilit19} which only comes with Emacs, or @file{font-lock} which is
the package of choice with XEmacs. If you are not familiar with these
highlight packages you'll have to check their sources for installation
guidelines, etc..

Use @code{sml-load-hook} to tell Emacs which scheme you prefer for
SML mode. For example:

@lisp
(add-hook 'sml-load-hook '(lambda () (require 'sml-font)))
@end lisp

@noindent
This ensures the SML extensions to @file{font-lock} will be available
once SML mode loads (from @file{sml-font.el}---if you prefer
@file{hilit19} you should @code{(require 'sml-hilite)} instead.

The variable @code{sml-font-lock-extra-keywords} is for further
customising @file{font-lock} for SML mode. The value of the variable
should be a list of strings, each of which is a regular expression that
should match the desired keyword exactly. Here's an example:

@lisp
(setq sml-font-lock-extra-keywords 
      '("\\babstraction\\b" "\\bfunsig\\b" "=>" "::"))))
@end lisp

@noindent
The @code{\b} marks a word boundary, according to the syntax table
defined for SML mode. Backslash must be quoted inside a string.
@xref{Regexps,,,emacs,The Emacs Editor Manual}, for a summary of Emacs'
regular expression syntax. 


Finally, the variable @code{sml-font-lock-auto-on} can be used to
control whether or not @file{font-lock} should be enabled by default in
SML mode buffers; it is enabled by default. The @code{sml-hilite}
package is customisable, but only with regard to colour changes.

You can indeed. @code{sml-insert-form} is extensible so all you need to
do is create the macros yourself. Define a @emph{keybord macro}
(@kbd{C-x (} <something> @kbd{C-x )}) and give it a suitable name:
@code{sml-addto-forms-alist} prompts for a name, say @code{NAME}, and
binds the macro @code{sml-form-NAME}. Thereafter @kbd{C-c @key{RET}
NAME} will insert the macro at point, and @kbd{C-u C-c @key{RET} NAME}
will insert the macro after a @code{newline-and-indent}. If you want to
keep your macros from one editing session to the next, go to your
@file{.emacs} file and call @code{insert-kbd-macro}; you'll need
to add @code{NAME} to @code{sml-forms-alist} permanently yourself:

@lisp
(defun my-sml-load-hook () "Global defaults for SML mode"
  ;; whatever else you do
  (setq sml-forms-alist (cons '("NAME") sml-forms-alist)))
@end lisp

If you want to create templates like `case' that prompt for parameters
you'll have to do some Lisp programming. The @code{tempo} package looks
like a good stating point. You can always overwrite your own macros, but
the builtin forms for `let', etc., can't be overwritten.

The question is whether you can! See the @code{sml-buffer} variable's
on-line help (@kbd{C-h v sml-buffer}). Note that the SML mode
compiler variables (@pxref{Process Defaults}) are all buffer-local, so
you can even switch between different ML compilers, not just different
invocations of the same one. Well, you @emph{can}.

@emph{What needs to be done to support other ML compilers?}
@end flushright

@sp 1
@noindent
Not that much really, at least not to create minimal support. The
interface between SML mode and the compiler is determined by the
variables
@code{sml-use-command},
@code{sml-cd-command},
@code{sml-prompt-regexp}
(which are easy to get right), and
@code{sml-error-regexp}, and
@code{sml-error-parser} (which are more tricky). 
The general template to follow in setting this up
is in the files @file{sml-@{poly-ml,mosml@}.el}.
These rules will not change, I hope:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{sml-next-error} uses @code{sml-error-regexp} to locate the start
of the next error report in the ML interaction buffer (@var{P})

@item
@code{sml-next-error} calls @code{sml-error-parser}, passing @var{P}, and
expects up to five return values in this order:

@enumerate
@item file name in which the error occurs (@var{F})
@item start line of the error (@var{L} > 0)
@item start column of the error (@var{C})
@item an Emacs Lisp expression to be @code{eval}'d 
at (@var{L},@var{C}) in @var{F} (@var{EOE})
@item the actual text of the one-line error report (@var{MSG})
@end enumerate


@item 
@code{sml-error-parser} can assume that @var{P} is the start of the next
error message that the user is interested in---since she defines this
point by defining @code{sml-error-regexp}.

@item
What @code{sml-error-parser} returns is a list. In the event of problems,
I foresee the following needs:

@itemize -
@item if the file is the standard input,
return @code{("std_in" @var{L} @var{C})}
@item if the file cannot be inferred,
return @code{(nil @var{L} @var{C})}
@item if @var{L}=0, or the start cannot be inferred,
return @code{(@var{F} nil @var{C})}
@item if the start column cannot be inferred,
return @code{(@var{F} @var{L} 1)}
@end itemize
@end itemize

There's no need to return anything else. However, if you do want the
errorful text in @var{F} highlighted you should return a simple Lisp
expression in the fourth argument that'll compute the region. @var{EOE}
will be called with point at character (@var{L},@var{C}) in @var{F}, and
should move point to the end of the errorful text. In fact, @var{EOE}
can actually do anything you wish, but in the simplest cases it'll just
@code{(forward-char 45)}, or

@lisp
(progn (forward-line 4) (forward-char 37))
@end lisp
@noindent
etc.. If it does more, make sure it leaves point at the end of the
region in @var{F}---use @code{save-excursion} if switching buffers.
@var{MSG}, if returned, will be echoed in the minibuffer.

SML Mode was written originally by Lars Bo Nielsen for Emacs 18.5n;
later hacked for comint by Olin Shivers (who called it @t{ml-mode});
much later hacked by myself because it didn't seem to work@dots{} Fritz
Knabe brilliantly posted the @code{hilit19} and @code{font-lock}
functions on the net. Lars probably would recognise much of what
remains, yet now there're menus, syntax highlighting, support for
various ML compilers, Texinfo (hey!), and more than a little hope it'll
work with a variety of Emacs 19s. But there are still things to do. Lars

This is still the main cause of grief; SML's syntax is a nightmare for
Emacs modes, and of course opinions vary about proper indentation. But
there may be something we can do@dots{}
