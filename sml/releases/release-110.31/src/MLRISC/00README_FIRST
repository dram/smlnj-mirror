   You should run sml, then type:

       use "makeall.sml";

   This should recompile everything


Regnerating Sources after Changing the Machine Descriptions 
-----------------------------------------------------------

   To regenerate all the architecture dependent files after changes,
   run sml, then type:

       use "make.sml";

Compiler Bugs 
-------------

   Version 110.25 of smlnj-lib is somehow missing IntHashTable.
   You should rebuild the library if you are using this version.

Useful Tools
------------

   The script cm/makecm can be used to regenerate the library list 
   of a cm file after changes to the source.

   The vim syntax file Tools/mdl.vim can be used to highlight the
   machine description files.  It works on Vim version 5.3 (or later).
