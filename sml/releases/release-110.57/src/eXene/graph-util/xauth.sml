 * Support for X11 authentication.  The authentication file, which is
 * specified by the XAUTHORITY variable (default $HOME/.Xauthority),
 * consists of a sequence of entries with the following format:
 *
 *      2 bytes         Family value (second byte is as in protocol HOST)
 *      2 bytes         address length (always MSB first)
 *      A bytes         host address (as in protocol HOST)
 *      2 bytes         display "number" length (always MSB first)
 *      S bytes         display "number" string
 *      2 bytes         name length (always MSB first)
 *      N bytes         authorization name string
 *      2 bytes         data length (always MSB first)
 *      D bytes         authorization data string
 *
 * This implementation is partially based on code contributed by Juergen Buntrock.
