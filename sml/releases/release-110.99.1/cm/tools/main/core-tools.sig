     * the context, which will temporarily change the current working
     * directory to the one that holds the description file ("the context").
     * If this is not necessary for the rule to work correctly, then
     * one can simply ignore the context (this saves system call overhead
     * during dependency analysis).
     * If the rule yields a genuine partial expansion (where the resulting
     * spec list is not empty), then it must pass the proper "path maker"
     * along with each new name.  For most cases this will be the given
     * "native path maker" because most rules work on native path names.
     * Some rules, however, might want to use the same convention for
     * derived specs that was used for the original spec. *)
