These are template files for the glue needed to put an ML callable
library together.  See the "HOWTO-ADD-C-CODE" file in the "notes"
directory for complete details.  The files are used as follows:

  makefile		a makefile template; define the make variables LIBRARY
			and OBJS.

  cfun-proto-list.h	copy this file unchanged

  cfun-list.h		copy this file, and replace the fields in <<>>.  Add
			a CFUNC entry for each C function that is callable from
			ML.

  library-template.c	copy and rename this file; change the <<LibraryName>>
			to the name of your library table.
