# The SDK variable is set to the SDK minimum Mac OS X version that you want
# to support.  Note that since Lion, the 10.5 (and 10.6?) SDKs are not part
# of the Xcode install.

# to support 10.5 and later you will need to have the 10.5 SDK in /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk
#
#SDK =		-isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk -mmacosx-version-min=10.5

# this should work on Lion, if you had Xcode 4.2 installed.
