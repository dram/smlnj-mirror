\section{Frequency Driven Compilation}

Most optimizations in MLRISC are driven by execution frequencies
estimates provided by the front-end.  These can be in the form of explicit
vertex and edge frequencies, in the form of branch probabilities, or a
combination of the above.  Frequency information can be propagated
to the backend via the \href{annotations.html}{annotations} mechanism.
