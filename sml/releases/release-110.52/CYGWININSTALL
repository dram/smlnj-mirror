Installation instructions for SML/NJ under Cygwin 
-------------------------------------------------

1. Set SMLNJ_CYGWIN_RUNTIME=1 and export the environment variable.
   E.g.,

       SMLNJ_CYGWIN_RUNTIME=1
       export SMLNJ_CYGWIN_RUNTIME

   in Bourne sh and variants.  Or

       setenv SMLNJ_CYGWIN_RUNTIME 1

   in csh and variants.      
    
   When this is set SML/NJ will select the Cygwin runtime instead of
   the default Windows runtime.

2. Simply treat Cygwin as a Unix, and follow the usual installation
   instructions.
