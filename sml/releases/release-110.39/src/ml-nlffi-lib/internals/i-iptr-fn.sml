(*
 * i-iptr-fn.sml   Leave an "incomplete" C type "incomplete".
 *
 *   The code generated from a C interface (call it <A>) containing an
 *   "incomplete" type (i.e., a pointer to a named but otherwise undefined
 *   struct or union, call it <foo>) will be a functor that takes a structure
 *   argument representing this incomplete (pointer-)type.
 *
 *   If (struct or union) <foo> has no known definition in any other
 *   participating C interface (i.e., when it is abstract), then
 *   one must generate a new structure (containing brand-new, abstract types)
 *   to be supplied as the functor's argument:
 * 
 *   <A>.<A>Fn (...
 *          structure I_S_<foo> = PointerToIncompleteType ()
 *          ...)
 *
 *   If a definition for <foo> is available, then one must use that
 *   instead. See c-iptr-fn.sml.
 *
 *   If the same abstract type is being used abstractly in several
 *   different participating C interfaces, then one must pass the same
 *   structure to all relevant functors:
 *
 *   structure I_S_<foo> = PointerToIncompleteType ()
 *   <A>.<A>Fn (... structure I_I_<foo> = I_S_<foo> ...)
 *   <B>.<B>Fn (... structure I_I_<foo> = I_S_<foo> ...)
 *   ...
