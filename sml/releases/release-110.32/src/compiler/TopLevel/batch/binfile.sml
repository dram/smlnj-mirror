 *
 * IMPORT TREE FORMAT description:
 *
 *  The import tree area contains a list of (pid * tree) pairs.
 *  The pids are stored directly as 16-byte strings.
 *  Trees are constructed according to the following ML-datatype:
 *    datatype tree = NODE of (int * tree) list
 *  Leaves in this tree have the form (NODE []).
 *  Trees are written recursively -- (NODE l) is represented by n (= the
 *  length of l) followed by n (int * node) subcomponents.  Each component
 *  consists of the integer selector followed by the corresponding tree.
 *
 *  The size of the import tree area is only given implicitly. When reading
 *  this area, the reader must count the number of leaves and compare it
 *  with importCnt.
 *
 *  Integer values in the import tree area (lengths and selectors) are
 *  written in "packed" integer format. In particular, this means that
 *  Values in the range 0..127 are represented by only 1 byte.
 *  Conceptually, the following pickling routine is used:
 *
 *    void recur_write_ul (unsigned long l, FILE *file)
 *    {
 *      if (l != 0) {
 *        recur_write_ul (l >> 7, file);
 *        putc ((l & 0x7f) | 0x80, file);
 *      }
 *    }
 *
 *    void write_ul (unsigned long l, FILE *file)
 *    {
 *      recur_write_ul (l >> 7, file);
 *      putc (l & 0x7f, file);
 *    }
 *
 * CODE AREA FORMAT description:
 *
 *  The code area contains multiple code segements.  There will be at least
 *  two.  The very first segment is the "data" segment -- responsible for
 *  creating literal constants on the heap.  The idea is that code in the
 *  data segment will be executed only once at link-time. Thus, it can
 *  then be garbage-collected immediatly. (In the future it is possible that
 *  the data segment will not contain executable code at all but some form
 *  of bytecode that is to be interpreted separately.)
 *
 *  In the binfile, each code segment is represented by its size s (in
 *  bytes -- written as a 4-byte big-endian integer) followed by s bytes of
 *  machine- (or byte-) code. The total length of all code segments
 *  (including the bytes spent on representing individual sizes) is codeSzB.
 *
 * LINKING CONVENTIONS:
 *
 *  Linking is achieved by executing all code segments in sequential order.
 *
 *  The first code segment (i.e., the "data" segment) receives unit as
 *  its single argument.
 *
 *  The second code segment receives a record as its single argument.
 *  This record has (importCnt+1) components.  The first importCnt
 *  components correspond to the leaves of the import trees.  The final
 *  component is the result from executing the data segment.
 *
 *  All other code segments receive a single argument which is the result
 *  of the preceding segment.
 *
 *  The result of the last segment represents the exports of the compilation
 *  unit.  It is to be paired up with the export pid and stored in the
 *  dynamic environment.  If there is no export pid, then the final result
 *  will be thrown away.
 *
 *  The import trees are used for constructing the argument record for the
 *  second code segment.  The pid at the root of each tree is the key for
 *  looking up a value in the existing dynamic environment.  In general,
 *  that value will be a record.  The selector fields of the import tree
 *  associated with the pid are used to recursively fetch components of that
 *  record.
