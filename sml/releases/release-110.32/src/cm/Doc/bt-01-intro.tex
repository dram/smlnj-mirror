\section{Introduction}

With the exception of the runtime system which is written in C,
compiler and interactive system for Standard ML of New Jersey
(SML/NJ)~\cite{appel91:sml} are themselves implemented in Standard
ML~\cite{milner97}.  At the time the new Compilation and Library
Manager (CM)~\cite{blume00:newcm} was introduced, all ML code has been
reorganized in such a way that the SML/NJ system itself works like any
other stand-alone ML program compiled by SML/NJ.

However, there are a few important differences between compiling an
ordinary ML program using CM and (re-)compiling the interactive system
itself.  These differences are handled by a special-purpose version of
the compilation manager: the bootstrap compiler.  Its interface is
{\tt structure CMB}, exported from library {\tt \$smlnj/cmb.cm}.

This document describes how to use the bootstrap compiler and also
explains what the differences to ordinary ML code are.
