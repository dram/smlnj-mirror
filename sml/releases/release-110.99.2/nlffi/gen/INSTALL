Installation instructions for ML-NLFFI-Gen
------------------------------------------

ML-NLFFI-Gen will normally be automatically
installed as part of the SML/NJ system
by the SML/NJ installer.

To install by hand (e.g., if you make
your own modifications), run the

    ./build

script in this directory and then move
the file

    ml-nlffigen.$ARCH-$OS

to the heap-file directory.

Running ./build requires a properly
functioning installation of SML/NJ and
the C-Kit (i.e., CM library $/ckit-lib.cm).
