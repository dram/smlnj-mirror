This is an "beta" release of a completely new implementation of CML.
It has been in use since the Fall'96, and seems to be robust.
The doc/HTML directory has partial HTML documentation for this version.

In keeping with the migration of SML/NJ to the SML'97 standard, this version
of CML has a number of changes in the API.  See the file doc/HTML/porting.html
for more information.
