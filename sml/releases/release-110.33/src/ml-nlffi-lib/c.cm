(*
 * A new foreign-function interface for SML.
 *   This interface is actually an interface to C.  It is based on
 *   an encoding of C's type system in ML.
 *   This library is a helper library for use by automatically generated
 *   code.  (An auxiliary tool produces this code directly from C code.)
