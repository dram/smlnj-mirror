                              WARNING
        This version is intended for compiler hackers. The 
        version ought to be stable, however we have not run
        our full regression testing.

<dl>
<dt>Summary:
<dd>A number of small, but important bug fixes.</dd>
</dl>

<hr>

<h3>Details:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a space leak in the CML implementation of TextIO and BinIO.</li>
<li>Fixed the handling of <tt>%g</tt> in the Format library module.</li>
<li>Ported to MacOS X 10.2 (Jaguar).  The MacOS X 10.1 and 10.2 runtime
systems are different.  The former is called run.ppc-darwin5
and the latter is run.ppc-darwin.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in division by zero on the PowerPC.</li>
<li>Sml now senses the <tt>SMLNJ_HOME</tt> environment variable.
If this is set,
then the bin dir is assumed to be in <tt>$SMLNJ_HOME/bin</tt> and (unless
<tt>CM_PATHCONFIG</tt> is also set), the path configuration file is
assumed to be in <tt>$SMLNJ_HOME/lib/pathconfig</tt>.  This way one can
easily move the entire tree to some other place and everything will
``just work''.  Companion commands such as <tt>ml-build</tt> and
<tt>ml-makedepend</tt> also sense this variable.</li>
</ul>
