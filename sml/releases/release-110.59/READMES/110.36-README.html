<h3>Summary:</h3>
 
<ul>
   <li>This is a bugfix release, mainly with the purpose of solving a problem
with the FLINT optimizer that was erroneously throwing away code in some
cases.</li>
  <li>Other changes include a minor bugfix for ml-lex, the implementation
of a "minimal" structure Compiler, and switching over to an improved code
generator on the x86 (affecting floating-point computations).<br>
  </li>
 
</ul>

<h4>FLINT:   </h4>
 
<ul>
  <li>There was a problem with FLINT occasionally using the wrong continuation
for certain functions because of a faulty internal analysis.&nbsp; Fixed.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>MLRISC (x86):   </h4>
 
<ul>
   <li>An updated version of the x86-fp module has been enabled by default.
 This results in significant speedups for FP-intensive code.</li>
 
</ul>
 
<h4>Interactive system / libraries:</h4>
 
<ul>
  <li>A minimal version of structure Compiler is that only contains "version"
and "architecture" is available at toplevel.&nbsp; Thus, legacy code that
wants to test the current version number can do so without having to load
the rather heavy (and obsolete) full structure Compiler from $smlnj/compiler/compiler.cm.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>ML-Lex:</h4>
 
<ul>
  <li>Bug 1581 (concerning open parentheses in constant strings) has been
fixed.</li>
</ul>
