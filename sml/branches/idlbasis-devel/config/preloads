# Modules to be pre-loaded during bootstrap.
#   Each line should have the form "command libname" where "command" is
#   either "autoload" or "make" and where "libname" is suitable as an
#   argument to CM.autoload or CM.make.
#
# Make sure that at least $smlnj/cm.cm is being registered here.
#

# The SML Basis library:
autoload $/basis.cm

# The Compilation Manager (structure CM)
autoload $smlnj/cm.cm

# The Visisble Compiler (collection of structures)
autoload $smlnj/compiler.cm

# The Visisble Compiler (old style: structure Compiler)
#autoload $smlnj/compiler/compiler.cm

# If you don't autoload the old-style visible compiler above, then
# you should make a minimal version of it available so that
# Compiler.version as well as Compiler.achitecture are available:
autoload $smlnj/compiler/minimal.cm

# The SML/NJ Library
autoload $/smlnj-lib.cm

# The Bootstrap Compilation Manager (structure CMB)
#autoload $smlnj/cmb.cm
