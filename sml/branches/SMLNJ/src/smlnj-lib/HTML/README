This library provides support for parsing and pretty-printing HTML.
The file html-sig.sml and html.sml define a parse-tree representation
of HTML 3.2 (as defined in the August 21st, 1993 draft).

Note that this is a fairly strict interpretation of the standard;
non-standard tags and attributes will cause errors.  To allow some
flexibility, the parser is functorized over a collection of error
reporting functions (see html-error-sig.sml).

The file test-parser.sml gives an example of how the parser part of the
library can be used.

TODO LIST:

The pretty-printer needs to be rewritten to deal with line breaks better.

Some library support for entities (e.g., "&lt;" should be provided).
