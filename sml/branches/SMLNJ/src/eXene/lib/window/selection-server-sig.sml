 * This is the lowest-level interface to the ICCCM selection protocol.
 * There is one selection server per display connection.
 *
 * NOTES:
 *  - what about incremental transfers?
 *  - currently these operations take a window as an argument, since the
 *    protocol requires one.  The selection server could allocate an unmapped
 *    window to serve as the source of ids, which would make selections
 *    independent of specific windows.  Let's see how the higher-level interfaces
 *    work out first.
