(*
 * Hook module for CM.
 *   This module exists to break the static dependency between CM and
 *   the compiler.  This way we avoid lengthy waits for the autoloader
 *   when touching CM at the interactive toplevel.
 *   (CM is there and running at bootstrap time, so it can easily
 *    install itself into the hook if this is what's desired.)
