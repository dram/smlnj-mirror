(* 
 * This is the interactive system;
 * At link-time (i.e., at bootstrap time) this code builds the boot
 * environments, sets default signal handlers, and then dumps a heap.
 * When the heap image restarts, the system goes interactive.
 * 
 * (We do not want to go interactive before dumping the heap because it
 * would mean that environments get loaded unnecessarily.)
 *
 * This code refers directly to structure Compiler, because by the time it
 * gets compiled, CM's conditional compilation facility has already
 * made sure that structure Compiler refers to the visible compiler
 * for the current architecture.
