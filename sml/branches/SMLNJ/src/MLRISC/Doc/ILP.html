<h2> Introduction </h2>
    This section is under construction.  A new scheduler framework
for superscalars that ties into the machine description language
is currently being developed.
<h2> The ILP ToolBox </h2>
<h3> List Scheduler </h3>
<h3> Ranking Algorithms </h3>
   Some more complex ranking algorithms (than say critical path) have been
implemented.  These are:
<ul>
 <li> The algorithm of <a href="../scheduling/PalemSimons.sig" target=code>
      Palem and Simons </a> which appeared in TOPLAS '93.  This algorithm
      computes the modified deadlines of a set instructions, with
      precedence, latency, and deadlines constraints.
      
 <li> The algorithm of 
      <a href="../scheduling/LeungPalemPnueli.sig" target=code>
      Leung, Palem, and Pnueli </a> which appeared in PACT '98.
      This algorithm computes the modified deadlines of a set of instructions,
      with precedence, latency, release-times and deadline constraints.
</ul>
