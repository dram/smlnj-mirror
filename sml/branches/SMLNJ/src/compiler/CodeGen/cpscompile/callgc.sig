(* All code to invoke GC is generated once at the end of the

 * call to GC is a jump  to the end of the cluster  where there 
 * is another jump.
 * Code to invoke GC for known functions is generated at the end of
 * the cluster. This is important as there may be spilling across
 * gc invocation calls.
