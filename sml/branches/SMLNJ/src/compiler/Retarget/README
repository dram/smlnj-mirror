New setup for "RETARGET":

To support cross-compilation for <arch>-<os>, the following files must be
present in this directory:

1. <arch>-<os>.sml, containing the following SML code:

   structure <Arch><OS>CMB =
       CMBFun (structure TargetCompiler = <Arch>VisComp
	       val version = "batch (target: <arch>-<os>)"
	       val targetosn = "<os>")

2. <arch>-<os>.cm, containing the following CM group description:

  Group
	structure <Arch><OS>CMB
  is
	../viscomp-lib.cm
	../../cm/cm-lib.cm
	<arch>-<os>.sml


Furthermore, the new combination should be registered in all.cm.

To load the cross-compiler for <arch>-<os>, one must be in the
compiler source directory, run SML/NJ and type

	CMB.retarget { cpu = "<arch>", os = "<os>" };

at the interactive prompt.

(Note that this command is more or less a shorthand for
   CMB.CM.make' ("Retarget/<arch>-<os>.cm", false);
In other words, cross-compilers are ordinary CM modules. However, some
internal trickery is done to avoid using the "wrong" pervasive environment...)
