(* Norman Ramsey: *)
(* I can imagine at least three implementations: one that doesn't
 * support resynchronization, one that supports resynchronization only at
 * column 1, and one that supports arbitrary resynchronization.
 *
 * \section{Implementation}
 * This implementation supports arbitary resynchronization.
 *
 * changed ErrorMsg to use SourceMap to get source locations; only the
 * formatting is done internally
 *
 * added SourceMap structure
 *)

(* DBM: what is "resynchronization" and what is it used for?  Is there any
 * reason to continue to support it (and maintain the extra code complexity)?
 * If this was a feature used only by Ramsey's noweb utility, which is defunct,
 * then we could simplify the sourcemap code.  -- John claims that resynchronization
 * is still relevant. *)

structure SourceMap : SOURCE_MAP = struct

  (* A character position is an integer.  A region is delimited by the
   * position of the start character and one beyond the end.
   * It might help to think of Icon-style positions, which fall between
   * characters.
   *)

  type charpos = int
  type 'a pair = 'a * 'a
  type region = charpos pair
  val nullRegion : region = (0,0)
  type sourceloc = {fileName:string, line:int, column:int}

  (* The empty region (nullRegion) is conventional. *)

  fun span ((0,0), r) = r
    | span (r, (0,0)) = r
    | span ((l1, h1), (l2, h2)) = if l1 < h2 then (l1, h2) else (l2, h1)

(* The representation is a pair of lists.
     linePos:    line numbers for newlines and resynchronization.
     resynchPos: file name and column for resynchronization.

   The representation satisfies these invariants:
     * The lists are never empty (initialization is treated as a resynchronization).
     * Positions decrease as we walk down the lists.
     * The last element in each list contains the smallest valid position.
     * For every element in resynchPos, there is a corresponding element in
       linePos with the same position.

   We could get even more clever and store file names only when they
   differ, but it doesn't seem worth it---we would have to get very
   clever about tracking column numbers and resynchronizations.
