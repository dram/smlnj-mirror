(* sourcemap.sml *)

(* Norman Ramsey: *)
(* I can imagine at least three implementations: one that doesn't
 * support resynchronization, one that supports resynchronization only at
 * column 1, and one that supports arbitrary resynchronization.
 *
 * This implementation supports arbitary resynchronization.
 *
 * Changed ErrorMsg to use SourceMap to get source locations; only the
 * formatting is done internally.
 *
 * Added SourceMap structure.
 *)

(* DBM: what is "resynchronization" and what is it used for?  Is there any
 * reason to continue to support it (and maintain the extra code complexity)?
 * If this was a feature used only by Ramsey's noweb utility, which is defunct,
 * then we could simplify the sourcemap code.  -- John claims that resynchronization
 * is still relevant (examples?). *)

(* DBM: "Resynchonization" supports a model where the input stream for a compilation
 * unit is made up of multiple source files.  These may be combined either by
 * concatenation or inserting one file in the middle of another (like #include
 * in cpp).  We'll call the pieces of source that are being combined "file segments"
 * or "segments" for short.
 *
 * We'll assume that minimal granularity for resynchonization is a 
 * source line (i.e. no switching files in the middle of a line).
 * The boundaries between source file segments will be marked by #line
 * commands embedded in comments.  These have the form '(*#line nn "filename"*)'
 * or '(*#line nn*)' where nn is a new line number at which the next segment
 * starts, and filename is the name of the file for the next segment. It is
 * assumed that the #line command comment will appear on a line by itself
 * (presumably inserted by an external preprocessor that is responsible for
 * combining source segments to form the input stream).  These #line commands
 * are recognized and interpreted by the lexer, which calls resynch to change
 * the state of the current sourcemap.
 *
 * QUESTION: Can a source region, which designates a contiguous region in the
 * input stream, cross one or more file segments?  Or should all regions created
 * during parsing and used in elaboration be within a single segment (and therefore
 * be associated with a single source file)? The type and implementation of
 * function fileregion imply that a region can span multiple segments.
 * 
 * QUESTION: Presumably, the original motivation for adding this feature was to support
 * Norman Ramsey's nw "literate programming" system, which we no longer support.
 * What new clients require this functionality?

  (* types ------------------------------- *)

  (* A character position is an integer.  A region is delimited by the
   * position of the start character and one beyond the end.
   * It might help to think of Icon-style positions, which fall between
   * characters.
   *)

  type charpos = int
    (* charpos is 1-based. I.e. the (default) position of the first character in the
     * input stream is 1 (????) *)

  type region = charpos * charpos
    (* INVARIANT: (lo,hi) : region ==> lo <= hi 
     * If region /= (0,0), then lo < hi, i.e. all non-null regions are nonempty. *)

  type sourceloc = {fileName:string, line:int, column:int}
    (* lines and columns are 1-based (minimum value is 1) *)

(* The representation of a sourcemap is a pair of lists.
     lines: line numbers for newlines and resynchronizations,
            labeled by initial charpos of lines
     files: file name for resynchronization, labeled by
            initial position for resynchronization

   The representation satisfies these invariants:
     * The lists are never empty (initialization is treated as a resynchronization).
     * Positions strictly decrease as we walk down the lists.
     * The last element in each list contains the smallest valid position.
     * For every element in files, there is a corresponding element in
       lines with the same position.

   We could get even more clever and store file names only when they
   differ, but it doesn't seem worth it---we would have to get very
   clever about tracking column numbers and resynchronizations.
