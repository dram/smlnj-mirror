Abstract syntax structures for modules

Structures
1. Basic (elabStr)

A basic structure expression

  struct <decls> end 


is translated into a structure declaration

  structure tempStrId = let <decls> in structure<locations> end

where <locations> is a list of bindings returned by extractSig
applied to the elaborated body decls.

  STRdec [
     STRB{name = tempStrId,
          def = LETstr(absDecl,STRstr(locations)),
	  str = resStr}
  ]

where 

  resStr = STR{sign,rlzn,access,prim}

where sign and rlzn are constructed from results of extractSig, and
access is a fresh lvar.

The <locations> bindings are the bindings for the identifiers declared
in <decls> that are exported as components of the structure. The only
relevant information in the bindings for translation are the access
fields (for variables, exception constrs, structures and functors).
Type components are not represented in <locations>.  So it mignt be
possible to strip <locations> down to a list of lvars.

The main translation info in the resStr STR is the access.  This access
info probably should be a direct element of the STRB data structure.
Then the STR would be only a "type" description for the structure.
This would make structure declarations more analagous to val declarations,
where a VALbind contains an access and a type as separate properties.
