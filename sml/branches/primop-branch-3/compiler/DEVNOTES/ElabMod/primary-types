Primary & Secondary types
---------------------

Concerning the translation of signatures (functor parameter signatures in particular) into kinded type variable abstractions.

A functor parameter signature will be translated into a type abstraction (TFUN) over several type variables.  These type variables correspond to certain tycon and functor elements of the signature, and the list is flattened over the signature hierarchy.

Any nondefined functor element gets a type variable, whose kind is derived from the functor signature of that element.

A tycon element is "primary", and gets a type variable, if it is _formal_, i.e. neither defined, nor a datatype.  Datatypes are viewed has having a defined structure given by the datatype spec.  The kind of the plambda type variable for a primary tycon is computed from the arity of the tycon (PLambdaType.tkc_int).  A formal tycon is a GENtyc with kind=FORMAL.

Only one type variable is included per sharing equivalence class of tycons (& functors?).  Hence instantiation (which determines the sharing equivalence classes and their representative elements) is naturally involved in the determination of the primary tycons and their plambda type variables.

It is therefore not possible (not easy?) to compute the primary tycons from a signature without performing instantiation or an analysis of sharing equivalence that would be closely related to instantiation.

How could the primary tycons of a signature be identified.

(a) a symbolic path
(b) an entity path
(c) a flexible stamp (associated with the representative tycon in an instantiation)

(a) and (b) are intertranslatable from the signature representation.  I.e.  given a symbolic path for an element, we follow that path, extracting the entityVar for each spec along the way to form the corresponding entity path.  Starting with the entity path, we can search for the corresponding element in successive elements lists and capture the corresponding symbolic names to form a symbolic path.

Representing a primary tycon as a flexible stamp, as in (c), is clearly relative to a particular
instantiation of the signature.

Unfortunately, because elaboration introduces tycons directly into the abstract syntax of the functor body, particularly GENtycs which can only be distinguished by their stamps, neither symbolic paths nor entity paths are adequate to identify primary types throughout the abstract syntax.  
-----------------------

Translating tycons.

Primary tycons need to be translated to the corresponding plambda type variable in the TransTypes (in toTyc).

Currently tycpaths (FLINT/trans/tycpath.sml) are used as an intermediate form in the translation from (frontend) types to plambda types.  It is likely that this intermediate representation can be eliminated.  

The tycpath for a tycon is either just the tycon itself (TP_TYC tyc), or a representation of a plambda type variable, TP_VAR{tdepth,num,kind}.   Compound tycpaths (TP_FCT, TP_APP,
and TP_SEL) have to do with functors and structures.

[Q: What is the role of TP_TYC?  Shouldn't all primary tycons be represented by a TP_VAR?
If so, are the arguments of TP_TYC secondary tycons?  In that case, what do they have to
do with the plambda type or kind?]
[A: TP_TYC encodes DATATYPEs, abstract GENtycs, and all other nonformals (PRIMITIVE and TEMP (which should be impossible at this point))]. 

---------------------
Determining the tkind (plambda kind) of a functor element.

A functor element in a signature is translated into a type function and also into a lambda term.  The type function has a kind (tkind), which must be computable from the functor signature.

PLambda kinds have the following forms:

fun K ... K -> K      -- an n-ary type operator
seq K ... K              -- an n-tuple of type constructors
    0 ... n                -- a basic tycon of arity k

----------------------
External functors and primary types in closures

Because pidinfo in persistent maps contain lty information for the given pid, the lty for externally referenced functor (i.e., an occurrence of a functor name that is defined outside the compilation unit), the FLINT lty must be computed. The lty does not have to be computed before elaboration of the functor variable for local functor variables because we do not create persistent map entries for those. 
[Q: What is a pidinfo, and where is it defined?]
[A: pidinfo is defined in translate.sml as a list with ANON or NAMED id as elements.]
[Q: Where in the code is the lty for an external functor computed?]
[A: The lty for the external functor is computed by mkAccInfo using a first-class function getLty. The getLty for the mkFct invocation of mkAccInfo is defined to be fn () => fctLty(...) where fctLty is defined in transtypes.]

We translate externally defined functor variables by looking through intermediate PATH accesses until we get to an EXTERN access. Then we compute the lty for that functor variable given that functor and compInfo. 
[Q: How?  What does compinfo have to do with this?]
[A: PATH accesses contain another access inside. Alternatively, we may end up with an LVAR but this is impossible because mkAccInfo checks that the access is indeed extern before we do this step. compinfo is pass through to support EvalEnt.evalApp. evalApp only uses the mkStamp part of compinfo.]

=========================

Idea: Replace paramRlzn with list of primary flexible stamps including functor stamps 

For each functor we enter, translate needs to keep track of all the primary type information, i.e., a list of flexible stamps for the primary types of the formal instantiation of the parameter signature.  When functors are nested, this gives rise to a list of lists of flexible tycon stamps (and also stamps of formal functor elements, whose type functions will also be referenced by plambda type variables).

[Q: What about functors? What information should we keep about formal functors?
A: We should be able to compute ]

For each FORMAL tycon occurrence, we need to look up the flexible
stamp of that tycon in the list of lists of flexible stamps
representing the functor abstracted tycons. This lookup, which should
always be successful, yields two numbers: the index in the outer list
gives the depth (of functor abstraction), which identifies the
particular functor abstraction that introduced that formal tycon.  The
position of the stamp in the corresponding inner list gives the number
(num) with respect to primaries of that abstraction.

For example, looking up the flexible stamp s1 in the abstraction environment

     [l1, l2, [a,b,c,s1,d,e], l4]

would yield depth=2, num=4 (assuming 0-based depth and 1-based num indexing, which I think is being used.  [NOTE: This assumes that depth is counted from the top-level.  If depth is counted outward from the current position as in conventional DeBruijn indexing, depth would be 1 instead.].

As we enter each functor during translation, we need to determine the list of flexible stamps of the primary tycons and functors of its parameter instantiation, and we add this list to the end of the abstraction environment.  [Or should it be added to the front of the environment list?  This depends on whether depth is counted relative to top-level or relative to current abstraction depth.]

Regardless of the method used for encoding the primary type information, the LAMBDA fctexp form must also carry that information because entity evaluation ultimately must produce a functor entity given only the LAMBDA, epc, and current entity environment. Any approach that requires modification of the functor entity form must suffer a similar shortcoming. That is to say, primary type information must be propagated through the LAMBDA fctexp because entity evaluation needs that information in order to produce a well-formed fctEntity. [DBM: Not clear what this para means -- try to clarify.]

Having determined the depth and num parts of the plambda type variable for a formal/primary element with reference to the abstraction environment, we need to also determine the tkind of that element in order to construct the corresponding plambda type variable.  If the item being translated is a FORMAL tycon, we have its arity and can immediately translate that into the appropriate tkind.  If the item is a formal functor, it is a FCT and we therefore have its functor signature. So we need to transate its functor signature into a tkind.

[Q: Can we translate a functor signature by itself into a tkind, or is any auxiliary information, e.g. an entityEnv, needed?]
[A: The functor signature alone is insufficient for computing tkinds mainly due to the presence and resolution mechanism of sharing constraints. Because functor signatures are instantiated and with them their respective functor parameter signatures, instantiation picks particular representatives or primary types.]
[DBM: I will assume that it is ok to use signature instantiation as a tool to translate a functor
signature into a tkind.  Whether it is important to avoid repeated instantiation of the same signature
(i.e whether we might need to memoize instantiations) is a separate issue of performance to be
addressed later.]

[Q: How should transtypes tpsKnd be adapted to use this new primary type information?]
[A: tpsKnd is used by tpsTyc (for functor tycons), fctRlznLty, and the FCTfct case of mkFctexp.]

Primary types

[Notation: /\ is Big Lambda, \/ is forall, \/ is the vacuous quantifier, and \ is lambda]

The following are some examples of how functor parameters translate into FLINT types. The only phenomenon not illustrated is the flattening of hierarchically nested structures in the functor parameter. 

functor F(X:
sig 
  type 'a t0 
  type t1 = int 
  functor G(Y:sig 
                type 'a u = 'a t0 
                functor H(Z:sig end):sig end 
              end): 
     sig 
       type u' = t1 
     end 
   type t2 
   val a : (int t0) * t1 * t2
end) 
= struct end;  

/\([M]=>M, M, ([[]=>[]]=>[])).     --  abstraction over (t0, t2, G),  primary elements of X
    \v1:STR([\/([]=>[]).FCT(\/[].FCT([],[]),[]), {TCAP(TV(1,0), PRIM(I)),PRIM(I),TV(1,1)}]).
            -- abstraction over the value part of X (v1), with a structure "STR" type
        { }   -- the empty structure body

[DBM: the printing conventions here are not very clear, maybe they can be improved
to make the terms more readable.

"/\" represents capital lambda, representing type variable abstraction (followed by a tuple of kinds for the abstracted type variables).
"\" represents ordinary value lambda abstraction, with a value variable (here "v1") annotated with
its type.
"STR" is presumable a value-level structure record.  Here this would be the value part of the
parameter structure X.  In this case the structure contains two value elements, G and a.
The type of a is expressed by {TCAP(TV(1,0), PRIM(I)),PRIM(I),TV(1,1)}, with TV(0,1) representing
t0, TV(1,1) representing t2 (the 0th and 1st elements of the abstracted type tuple).
The type of the G functor element must be represented by \/([]=>[]).FCT(\/[].FCT([],[]),[]).
Does "\/" represent a polymorphic quantification?  I'm not sure how to parse this
type expression.
]

Formal type components such as t0 and t2 translate into type abstractions of the appropriate kind (may be a non-monokind, e.g., t0 is kind [M]=>M). They are indexed according to type abstraction depth and position in the formal argument list. For example, F has two formal type arguments, t0 and t2 which occur in the body as TV(1,0) and TV(1,1) respectively. The first index is the deBruijn index. The second is the position of that formal in the list of all formals up to sharing equivalence.  

The formal functor G is decomposed into a type abstraction part of kind ([[]=>[]]=>[]) and a lambda part of type \/([]=>[]).FCT(\/[].FCT([],[]).[]). 


---------------
Another example:

functor F(X:sig type t functor G(Y:sig type s val x : s * t end): sig type u end end) = ...

/\(M,[M]=>[M]).\v1: STR(\/[M].FCT(STR[TYC{TV(1,0),TV(2,0)}],STR(STR([])))))

functor F(X:sig type t end) = 
struct
  functor G(Y:sig val x : X.t end) = struct end
end

structure M = F(struct type t = int end)

\v8:
   STR([\/[M].
         [FCT([STR([])],
          [STR([STR([\/[].[FCT([STR([TYC(TV(2,0))])], [STR([STR([])])])])])])])]),
                       APP(TAPP(v8[0] [PRIM(I)]), v2)

functor H = M.G

\v1:STR(\/[].FCT(STR(TYC(PRIM(I))),STR(STR([]))))

FLINT types and examples of ML programs that use them

tcc_app: type operator applications

functor F(X:sig type 'a t val x : int t end) = ...

tcc_app(TV(1,0), [PRIM(I)])

tcc_fn: formal functor (typing for lambda abstraction)

functor F(X: sig functor G(Y:sig val a : int end):sig val b : bool end end) = ...

tcc_fn([STR([TYC(PRIM(I))])],[STR([(STR([TYC(bool)]))])])

tcc_proj: selection from formal functor body 

functor F(X: sig functor G() : sig type u end end) = struct structure M = G() functor H(Y:sig val x : M.u end) = struct end end;

...
   abstraction for H looks like:
    TFN(()
        FN(v7:
	   STR([TYC(PROJ(TCAP(TV(2,0), []), 0))]) ...) ...)

i.e., M.u translates to tcc_proj(tcc_app(TV(2,0), []), 0)
