Organization of FLINT/kernel

primop.sig/sml
  prim ops

primtyc.sig/sml
  prim types

lty.sig/sml
  basic types for plambda types, and their kinds
  tycI, ltyI, tkindI -- concrete representations
  tyc, lty, tkind -- hashed representations
  tycEnv -- type environments for closures (encoded as tyc)

pplty.sml
  pretty printing plambda types
  uses: lty.sml

ltykindchk.sml
  kind checking for types
  uses: lty.sml

ltynorm.sig/sml (was ltykernel)
  normalization and equivalence functions for types
  uses: lty.sml, pplty.sml

ltystructure.sig/sml (was ltydef)
  structural operations for manipulatiing the abstract hashed representations
  tkind, tyc, lty without pattern matching.
  Sets of constructors, destructors, and predicates.
  Some operations specialized for CPS or Plambda only.
  defines: LtyStructure: LTYSTRUCTURE
  uses: lty.sml

ltydict.sml

ltyutil.sig/sml (was ltybasic)
  generic utility functions for working with plambda/flint types
  defines: LtyUtil: LTYUTIL
  uses: PrimTyc (primtyc.sml)
	Lty (lty.sml)
	LtyNorm (ltynorm.sml)

ltymisc.sig/sml (was part of ltyextern)
  more specialized utility functions on types

ltyextern.sig/sml
  combined interface consisting of the union of
  LtyStructure, LtyUtil, and LtyMisc, with a few added definitions
  from Lty and LtyNorm
