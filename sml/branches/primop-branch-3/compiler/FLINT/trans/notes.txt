TransTypes

* primaryEnv should be generalized to an environment that deals with all
the different sources of LT.tcc_fn abstractions.

* which tycons are collected in the freetycs field of datatypes?  Are
  these exactly the volatile primaries that appear in the dataype dcon
  signature?

* what _tycons_ are translated into LT.tcc_var db indexes?

    -- those that have kind FORMAL, and correspondingly appear at some
         level in the current primaryEnv.  This primaryEnv level
	 corresponds to a functor abstraction. (TFN abstractor in
         functor expression translation (FCTfct case of mkFctexp in Translate))

    -- tycons referred to by FREEtyc and RECtyc within a datatype
         representation.  These are translated into local db indices
         refering to abstractions (tcc_fn) that are part of the the
	 same datatype representations. (tcc_fn abstractor)

* what else is translated into LT.tcc_var db indexes?

    -- tyvar with LBOUND(SOME{depth,index,...}) content, in tyToTyc.
         These are inferred, polymorphically abstracted univariables.
         The corresponding abstractor is the FLINT expression
         abstractor TFN.


Volatility and epcontext

* tycon is volatile if it is in the domain of the epcontext (primary or secondary)
* isFree (elabmod.sml) checks if a tycon is in the domain of epContext

* epcontext binds both GENtyc(FORMAL) and DEFtyc and GENtyc(DATATYPE) tycons
     (bindNewTycs in elabmod.sml)

Translating structures and functors into their LT.tyc's.  (getStrTycs, getFctTyc)

For nonvolatile structures, the simple version of getStrTyc should suffice.

For volatile structures defined inside a functor, particularly those
defined by application of a formal functor, we need to "type-check"
the functor body code.  This is also required in general for typing
functors themselves.

Example:
[type* and functor* identify primary elements. T_t and T_G are LT bound type
variables for the two F parameter primaries.]

functor F(X: sig
	               type* t								     T_t : M
		       functor* G(Y: sig type* s end) : sig type* u end      T_G :  [M] => M
       		    end  = 
struct
  structure A = G(struct type s = X.t end)
end

F: [T_t, T_G]  ->  str [ str [ proj(1)(app (T_G, str [T_t])) ] ]

where the anonymous structure argument of G has type:

     struct type s = X.t end  :  str [T_t]

How to compile a functor to its LT type (LT.tyc).
--------------------------------------
(LT = PLambdaType)

Ingredients: 
1. functor signature
     paramsig, bodysig
2. exp : entityExp (= LAMBDA{param: entVar, body: strExp})
    from functor realization

1. get primaries from paramsig
2. bind them by pushing onto penv  (will we be looking primaries up there?)
2a. create LT.tyc entityEnv for parameter structure (instantiate parameter and
    map the resulting realization entityEnv to an LT entity env.

3. determine the result primaries (by instantiating bodysig, for instance)

Regular functor case:
4. Check whether functor is regular or formal.  If regular:
    body: entityExp = STRUCTURE{stampExp, entDec}

5. interpret the entDec from body, building an entity environment
    that maps element entity variables to LT tycs  [could ignore bindings
    that we know will not be result primaries?]

6. gather LT tycs for result by looking up result primary entpaths
    in entity environment built in step 5

Formal functor case (this can happen how?):
7. If formal (body = FORMstr sig):



---------------
Perhaps the representation of a signature should include a list of
entpaths for its primaries?  This might allow us to avoid reperforming
instantiation repeatedly in the translation phase.  The primarySig
information could be recovered from these entpaths and the signature
itself, but what about the instantiation stamps that are currently
stored in the primary triples?


---------------
We need a variant of instantiation that produces a LT.tyc env
instead of an entity env.  In general, typechecking entity decls
will be analagous to evaluating entity decls, except that the
input and output will be LT.tyc environments.

Pathtycs will be interpreted relative to such LT.tyc envs to
produce LT.tyc results.
