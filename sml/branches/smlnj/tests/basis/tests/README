This directory contains test cases for most of the required structures
in the new SML Basis Library.	    1995-03-23, 1996-04-19, 1997-03-12

The directory must contain this file "README" and three symbolic links:
	testlink -> README
	testcycl -> testcycl
	testbadl -> exists.not
It must not contain a file or directory named "exists.not".

To run all the tests, invoke (for Moscow ML):

	rm -f result *.dat
       	mosml -P full test.sml >& result
       	diff result result.ok

Some things which are specific to Moscow ML are indicated by the
comment (* MOSML *).
