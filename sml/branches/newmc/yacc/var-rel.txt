Variable Relevance of a Node

A node N is relevant to layer l:  vrel(N,l)
  if somewhere in N's OR tree there is a var (var or asvar) bound in layer l.

If vrel(N,l) and l is live(?), then N should be relevant for selection in genDecTree.  (selectBestRelevant)

Possible element of priority ordering of OR nodes (OR priority queue).

N1 > N2 if  size({l | vrel(N1,l)}) > size({l | vrel(N2,l)})
i.e. N1 is vrel to more layers than N2 is.

This factor could go after weight? and before #branch and #default?
