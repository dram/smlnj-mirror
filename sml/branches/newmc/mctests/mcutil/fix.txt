Fix for tt/mcutil/t1.sml bug:

revmc
FLINT/match/decisiontree.sml

Calculation of defaultDtOp in mkDecTree is conditional on length of *dtCases*, not on
length of *cases* being equal to the "number of constructors" given by signToWidth. If
some of the original OR-node cases did not survive the liveness test in mkCases, then
there will be fewer dtCases than cases, introducing a need for a default for the switch,
(which could be FAIL if liveDefaults is empty).
