The way things are done now, the registration of runtime system addresses
is always done.  For stand-alone systems, this shouldn't be necessary.
We might be able to avoid this by using function pointers to the CGlobals
functions, which get set to the right functions in the heap-io library.
Thus, if the heap-io stuff isn't included, then the CGlobals stuff won't
be linked either.
