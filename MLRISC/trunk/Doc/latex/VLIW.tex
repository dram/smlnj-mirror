\section{Optimizations for VLIW/EPIC Architectures}

\subsection{Overview}
Many newer architectures such as the upcoming IA-64 and the
DSPs such as the C6 are VLIW or so called EPIC machines.  
These architectures depends on the compiler to 
extract instruction level parallelism (\newdef{ILP})
and data level parallelism (\newdef{DLP}).

Optimizations for these architectures include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Hyperblock construction
  \item Predication and predicate analysis
  \item Hyperblock scheduling
  \item Modulo scheduling
\end{itemize}
