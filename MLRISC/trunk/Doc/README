You will need the following programs to build the documentation.

1.  Perl 5.004 or more recent
2.  LaTeX        (I use the TeTeX distribution)
3.  fig2dev 3.2  (from xfig)

To build the documentation do the following:

1.  In this directory, type make
2.  cd latex
3.  make again
4.  make again
5.  make again  (Three times to make LaTeX stablize on the cross references)

The HTML pages will be in the directory html, starting from html/index.html
The LaTeX documents will be in the directory latex.
