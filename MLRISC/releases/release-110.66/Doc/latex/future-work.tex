\section{Future Work}
\subsection{Short Term}

\begin{description}    
\item[Detailed user manual:]
    A detailed user manual describing the interfaces, algorithms, 
    and examples on how to put together code generators.
\item[Support for GC:]
      There is a strong interaction
     with support for GC and global code motion. MLRISC aims at
     providing a generic framework for code generators, and finding
     the right level of information to support GC and global code
     motion is an issue. I think we have several solutions to address
     this that need more evaluation.
\item[Other architectures:] There is the need to port
     to other architectures like the MIPS, and the IA-64.

\subsection{Long Term}
\begin{description}
 \item[Predicated VLIW compilation:] Currently, the framework
for predicated VLIW architectures compilation
is incomplete, and contain only one back end (C6)
\item[Other compilers:] I would really like to see some
major compiler effort bootstrapped with an MLRISC backend.
\item[Verification] It is extremely difficult to
debug errors in modules that perform aggressive code
reorganizations. Ideas from formal methods such as typed assembly
language (TAL) or Proof Carrying Code (PCC) are worth investigating.
