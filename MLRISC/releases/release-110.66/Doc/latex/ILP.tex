\section{ILP Optimizations}
\subsection{Introduction}
    This section is under construction.  A new scheduler framework
for superscalars that ties into the machine description language
is currently being developed.
\subsection{The ILP ToolBox}
\subsubsection{List Scheduler}
\subsubsection{Ranking Algorithms}
   Some more complex ranking algorithms (than say critical path) have been
implemented.  These are:
\begin{itemize}
 \item The algorithm of
 \mlrischref{scheduling/PalemSimons.sig}{Palem and Simons} 
  which appeared in TOPLAS '93.  This algorithm
      computes the modified deadlines of a set instructions, with
      precedence, latency, and deadlines constraints.
      
 \item The algorithm of 
      \mlrischref{scheduling/LeungPalemPnueli.sig}{Leung, Palem, and Pnueli} 
       which appeared in PACT '98.
      This algorithm computes the modified deadlines of a set of instructions,
      with precedence, latency, release-times and deadline constraints.
\end{itemize}
