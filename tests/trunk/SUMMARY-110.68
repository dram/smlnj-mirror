Summary of regression failures for 110.63
5/17/07

basis:

 real.sml
   fails test11c because of inaccurate printing of reals with large mantissa

bugs:

  bug3.sml, bug130.1.sml, bug538.sml
    printing of full type paths (S.T) instead of local path (T) (e.g. in inferred
    signature of functor F in bug130.1.sml)

  bug1307.sml (see also bug1490.1.sml, bug1551.1.sml)
    escape sequence \k causes unclosed string exception
    (should it cause bad escape sequence error instead?)
    But earlier duplicate error messages has been corrected.

  bug1388.1.sml
    architecture dependent: div32 and quot32 are "OK" on ppc, "WRONG(DIV)" on x86

  bug1415.1.sml
    Date is now implemented, but is output of Date.fmt correct?

  bug1451.1.sml
    architecture dependent: seems correct on ppc, wrong on x86?

  bug1509.1.sml
    architecture dependent: correct (Overflow) on ppc, Div on x86

  bug1607.1.sml
    value printed is architecture dependent (e.g. 0.0 for ppc, 1.22460635382E~16 for x86)
