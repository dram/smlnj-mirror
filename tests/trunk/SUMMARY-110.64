5/17/07

coresml:

 r012c-fl.sml
   first error message is spurious

 t013.sml
   n Div 0 raises Overflow instead of Div [ppc specific]


basis:

 real.sml
   fails test11c because of inaccurate printing of reals with large mantissa

 timer.sml
   Timer.cpu_timer prints as ?.InternalTime.cpu_timer

 word.sml, word8.sml, word32.sml
   n div 0 raises Overflow instead of Div [ppc specific]

modules:
 316.sml, 316.1.sml: 

    Former printing bug (caused by the spec being ERRORtyc) is
    partially fixed , but printing of type elements in an inferred
    functor result signature is incomplete, and we don't print the
    arity properly if arity > 0.  A better fix would replace the
    ERRORtyc spec in the inferred signature with a new DUMMYtyc
    constructor that carried the name and arity of the tyc element.

    A more expensive fix might print the functor result signature
    by instantiating the functor parameter sig and applying the
    functor to the instantiation, then printing the result structure.
