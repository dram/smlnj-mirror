1. Real.fmt regression failure (x86-darwin).

This is a known issue mentioned in several of the SUMMARY files in the tests
directory, so I assume we will continue to live with this.

test11c in basis/tests/real.sml fails.  This tests the strings produced by 
Real.fmt(StringCvt.FIX (SOME n)) for various values of n (0, 1, 2, 6).
This is what is produced by 110.74: 

- val x = 91827364509182.0;
- Real.fmt(StringCvt.FIX (SOME 0)) x;
val it = "91827364509182" : string
- Real.fmt(StringCvt.FIX (SOME 1)) x;
val it = "91827364509182.1" : string
- Real.fmt(StringCvt.FIX (SOME 2)) x;
val it = "91827364509182.10" : string
- Real.fmt(StringCvt.FIX (SOME 6)) x;
val it = "91827364509182.100000" : string

The expected strings (according to basis/tests/real.out) are:

"91827364509182", 
"91827364509182.0", 
"91827364509182.00",
"91827364509182.000000"

2. Apparent regression failure on timer.sml is due to variations
in exact times -- not a true regression.
