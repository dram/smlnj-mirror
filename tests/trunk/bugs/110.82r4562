This is a status report of running the "bugs" tests using revision 4562
of the compiler/basis, which is a post-110.82/pre-110.83 version.

The report is broken into two groups: first the tests that "failed".  Most of
these are because of changes in the error messages, etc.  The second group
are the "openbugs".  Each test has been marked as "OK", "BUG", "FIXED" (for
open bugs), or "CHECK" (for tests where the status needs more investigation).

Tests that "passed" are omitted from the lists
