Regression test summary for modules:
dotest.sh modules -sml -diff ~/sml/Dev/merge/bin/sml

After modifying prettyprinting in ElabData/modules/ppmod.smlm and
TopLevel/printing/ppdec.sml, 95 of 347 tests still fail, mostly
because of minor difference in printing of signatures
(i.e. differences in line breaks).  The differences have been
examined and there are only a couple test cases (tests/21.sml and
tests/22.sml) where type path printing (int vs ?.t) should be
corrected.  Other differences should be eliminated by resetting
the reference outputs after deciding on the desired style for
signature and functor signature printing.

Results for open bug tests 229, 277, 284, 295(?) are unchanged, except for
printing.  So these bugs still need to be fixed.
