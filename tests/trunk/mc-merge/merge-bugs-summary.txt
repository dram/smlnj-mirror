Regression test summary for bugs (2021.11.07):
dotest.sh bugs -sml -diff ~/sml/Dev/merge/bin/sml

200 of 892 tests fail

Almost all failures are minor differences in printing (i.e. different
line breaks) for module signatures and different printing of
unresolved overloading scheme type variables, e.g.
"'Z[INT]" versus "[int ty]" for an unresolved overloaded int. Other
failures are listed below. Also there are a few minor differences in
the wording of error messages.

-------------------
* bug0068.1.sml  "spurious"(?) signature spec error message after type
     error in structure body -- not in trunk -- FIX!
  bug0068.2.sml  -- identical to bug0068.1.sml

* bug0260.sml: no overflow exn.  32/64-bit dependent.  benign
  bug1012.sml
  bug1018.sml
  bug1088.1.sml
  bug1088.2.sml

* bug0279.sml: overflow occurs after more iterations -- 32/64-bit dependent. benign

* bug0327.sml: literal not too large -- 32/64-bit dependent. benign
   bug0836.1.sml
   bug0836.2.sml
   bug0874.sml
   bug1088.2.sml
  
[* bug0423.sml: incorrect printing of signature name: (same as trunk)
    "VECTOR_2015?" instead of "VECTOR" -- "identity" signature decls
    do not reset name (e.g. signature STRING = STRING_2015 in
    Basis/Implementation/string.sig).  -- should be fixed now]

* bug0607.sml: flawed type error message
   (since bool * bool not a possible argument type for overloaded "+" operator)

* bug0615.sml: results differ in order; probably benign?

[* bug0788.sml: rebinding nil and :: is no longer allowed; so new error
  messages are printed. OK. ]

* bug0828.sml: printing datatype elements for an open declaration
  (e.g. "open Bool"). minor, same in trunk. FIX after merge (if then)

* bug1219.sml: unexpected exception (bug?) in SML/NJ: Representation [Representation]
    -- also fails in 110_96_64 and trunk; FIX after merge
    (proper fix would involve conreps.sml, typeoper.sml, reify.sml, etc.)

* bug1227.sml: floating point results differ
    -- CHECK  (which is right?)
  bug1449.1.sml

* bug1248.2.sml: (blastWrite)
    "Fatal error -- blasting out of 1600108 bytes not supported yet!
    Increase allocation arena size."

* bug1306.sml: value restriction in play? -- same in trunk and 110.96. FIX after merge.
  ("val (x,y) = (nil,nil)" generalizes, but not "val (5,y) = (5,nil)")

[* bug1340.1.sml: missing Word31 structure -- same in trunk. OK?
  (have Word63 instead?)
  bug1375.2.sml ]

* bug1469.1.sml: CG printing differs -- benign?

* bug1526.s.sml: printing char literals (e.g. extracted from "\"");
    same in trunk.  Fix after merge.

[* bug1608.1.sml: Math.sin Math.pi ==> 0.0; trunk prints 0.0 -- OK ]
