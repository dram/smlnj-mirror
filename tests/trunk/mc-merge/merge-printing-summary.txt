Regression test results:
dotest.sh printing -sml ~/sml/Dev/merge/bin/sml

3.sml
11.sml
   indentation style for printing structure signatures has changed:

   old:

   structure S :
     sig
       <specs>
     end

   new:

   structure S : sig
     <specs>
   end

   I.e. dbm-style printing has been replaced by jhr-style

   Resolution: updated outputs 3.out and 11.out accordingly.
   (same as trunk)
