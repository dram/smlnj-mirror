This archive contains ML and Emacs Lisp code to support a visual Emacs
interface for Andrew Tolmach's SML debugger.  Complete documentation
is contained in the file visualDebug.tex.

The .sml files should be copied into the dbguser directory of the sml
distribution; they replace the existing dbguser files.  There is no
need to re-makeml the compiler, since all of the new debugging code
is installed at user level; to recreate the sml image, use
"dbguser/userlevel.sml" and then exportML.  A file named "makeDebug"
has been included to help you perform this step; type "sml <
makeDebug" and a new executable called smld will be created; it will
include the visual debugging code.

The files sml-mode.el and sml-debug.el should be copied to a directory
where emacs lisp code can be loaded.  If you copy them to a directory
named ~/elisp, Emacs will be able to find them if you insert the line

(setq load-path (cons "~/elisp" load-path))

into your .emacs file.

A file .sml.emacs has been included that contains startup code which
you should insert into your .emacs file.

Please contact me with any questions, suggestions or comments.
