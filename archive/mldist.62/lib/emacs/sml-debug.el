;; Label code (from label.el)

; This package allows small markers called labels to be placed temporarily
; on the screen.  A label is not intended to be part of the text in the
; buffer that it marks, and vanishes from the buffer as soon as the label
; vanishes from the screen.  This package was developed to help provide
; visual support for the sml debugger in emacs, but may be of more general
; use as well.
;
; While labels are present in a buffer, the buffer is placed into a minor
; mode called Label mode; while in that mode, the buffer is made read-only
; and should not be modified until all labels have been deleted from it.
; When in Label mode, the key sequence C-x C-q is bound to the command
; abort-label-mode, which removes all labels from the buffer and restores it
; to its unlabeled state.
;
; While in Label mode, a buffer is set to be visiting no file; that ensures
; that labels will not be saved to a file if emacs is exited.  The function
; label-visiting can be used to retrieve the name of the file that a
; labeled buffer was visiting before it was labeled.
;
; If a buffer is visiting a file, it must be unmodified (i.e. must have been
; saved to the file) before it can be labelled; that is so that if Emacs is
; exited while the buffer is still labelled, no information will be lost.
; Consequently, set-label-mode saves an unmodified buffer before entering
; label mode for that buffer.
