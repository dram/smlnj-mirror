TODO List for LazySML
--------------------- 

(Walid Taha)

Things that MUST be done:

A. Run current: [1/2]  (Slip due to Reppy's work at same time, and misc.
                        (on *release*).)
B. Bootstrap version:  [1]
C. Integrating (ONLY) new files.  [1/2]
D. Cleaning up and integrating matchcomp.  [1]
E. Primop clean-up. [1/2]

0. Scope of $ extend as far to the left as possible.  [1/2?]
1. Proper threading of environments.  This is not quite 
   right for modules yet.  [2]  Proper treatment of long path
   names should also consequently be possible.
2. Proper threading of environment in the local statement.  [1]
?. Not printing the "Warning" message whenever the Y combinator is used 
   (in a val rec lazy declaration).  [1 or 2]
4. Limit "val lazy" to variables.  [1/2]
5. Translating bench-marks (three, maybe four tests?) [3]
6. Testing.  [2 or 3 days]
7. Measurement.  (With nothing to compare against?)  [2]
8. Inlining map (and not map_).  Meeting to discuss.  [1/2 if all is well.]

9. Report on what I've been doing [3].

10.  Getting numbers from the hbc compilers, if time allows.

Total time: 20 days. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Style things (Things that I probably wont be able to do while I'm here.)

1. Threading the CE environment that is currently internal to lazycomp through
   the top-level.
2. Not threading the CE environment through expX.  Currently, a ref cell
   is used to emulate that threading (to encapsulate this information
   for now.)

Things that are a bit harder to do:

1. Inlining:  a) doing it, and b) collecting number for 
   performance.

2. Printing better type-error messages.
3. Echoing better information whenever a datatype is declared.
4. Echoing better information whenever a function is declared.

5. Proper propogation of mark-region information.

6. Documentation
