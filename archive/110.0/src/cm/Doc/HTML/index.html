1 Overview</A>
</H1>
<P>
CM is the compilation manager for Standard ML of New
Jersey&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="manual.html#milner89">MTH90</A>,<A
 HREF="manual.html#appel91:sml">AM91</A>].  It is loosely based on its
precursor SC&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="manual.html#harper94:irm">HLPR94b</A>,<A
 HREF="manual.html#harper-lee-pfenning-rollins-CM">HLPR94a</A>] and
provides functionality similar to the well-known U<font size=-1><small>NIX</small></font>-program
<TT>make</TT>&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="manual.html#feldman79">Fel79</A>].
<P>
CM simplifies the maintenance of large software systems by subdividing
them into a hierarchy of groups and libraries.  Groups and
libraries--collectively called entities--consist of individual SML
source files, other groups, and other libraries.
<P>
Unlike <TT>make</TT>, which is meant to be a general-purpose tool not
aimed at a specific language, CM provides automatic dependency
analysis and a form of separate compilation known as cutoff
recompilation&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="manual.html#tichy94">ATW94</A>].
<P>
The compilation manager uses the hooks provided by SML/NJ's open
compiler&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="manual.html#appel94:sepcomp">AM94</A>] and translates SML sources to produce
binary object files called binfiles.  The SML sources themselves can
be the result of executing other programs, which is accounted for by
CM's tools mechanism.  Examples of such tools are the version control
system RCS&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="manual.html#tichy85:rcs">Tic85</A>], the parser-generator
ML-Yacc&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="manual.html#tarditi90:yacc">TA90</A>], and the literate programming tool
noweb&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="manual.html#ramsey:simplified">Ram94</A>].
<P>
One important use for CM is the maintenance of SML/NJ's compiler,
which is not quite the same as maintaining other SML
programs&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="manual.html#appel94:bootstrap">App94</A>].  For that reason we offer a special
interface, which facilitates controlling batch compilation,
bootstrapping, and the process of retargeting the compiler to a
different machine architecture.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">
2 Why CM?</A>
</H1>
<P>
The basic function of CM is to perform separate compilation, automatic
dependency analysis, and selective recompilation for any SML program
consisting of more than one compilation unit.  But when the number of
compilation units is large, it becomes increasingly important
that they themselves can be grouped together and that explicit export
interfaces can be used to control namespaces. When there are many
groups, then one may want to organize them into supergroups, and so
on.

<B>Dependency hierarchy of CML.</B><SMALL>Separate compilation can be used to break large programs into smaller
pieces and to compile these smaller compilation units one at a time.
But in most cases we cannot compile a compilation unit in complete
isolation:  The result of the compilation depends on both the source
file itself and on the result of compiling other units.
Here <TT>trace-cml.sml</TT> depends on <TT>cml-sig.sml</TT>, which is
indicated by the presence of directed paths from the former to
the latter.  In fact, the graph contains as many as five such paths,
although each one of them would be enough for a dependency to exist.

</TABLE>
</DIV><BR>
<P>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="manual.html#fig:cml-hier">1</A> shows the dependency graph for CML's
sources.  CML&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="manual.html#reppy91:cml">Rep91</A>] is implemented as a regular SML/NJ
program.  Without the help from a compilation manager one would have
to invoke a number of <TT>use</TT> commands--one for each source
file--in order to load CML into SML/NJ.  Of course, the order in
which the commands are issued is important here, because identifiers
can only be referred to after they are defined.  Therefore, since <TT>
run-cml.sml</TT> refers to objects defined in <TT>cml-compat.sml</TT> the
former must be loaded after the latter.  More precisely, the sequence
of <TT>use</TT> commands has to be in topological order with respect to
the dependency graph.  Normally the programmer does not have the
benefit of looking at a diagram like figure&nbsp;<A HREF="manual.html#fig:cml-hier">1</A>; the
task of manually maintaining sources in topological order is tedious
and error-prone.
<P>
One feasible ordering of CML's sources is
<PRE>
app use
  [&quot;cml-base-sig.sml&quot;, &quot;cml-sig.sml&quot;, &quot;run-cml-sig.sml&quot;,
   &quot;cio-sig.sml&quot;, &quot;trace-cml-sig.sml&quot;, &quot;trace-cml.sml&quot;,
   &quot;cio.sml&quot;, &quot;cml-compat.sml&quot;, &quot;run-cml.sml&quot;,
   &quot;cml-version.sml&quot;, &quot;cml-base.sml&quot;, &quot;cml.sml&quot;, &quot;build.sml&quot;];
</PRE>
but clearly there are many others as well.  For example, <TT>
cml-version.sml</TT> could be moved further to the front of this list
without harm.  CM's dependency analysis automates the task of
determining a feasible ordering.
<P>
But not every source depends on every other source. In fact, we hope
that in a well-structured project there are relatively few
interdependencies between source files.  Therefore, it is usually
possible to perform selective recompilation when some but not all
source files have been changed.
<P>
The U<font size=-1><small>NIX</small></font> program <TT>make</TT> uses a policy where not only the
source that has been altered will be recompiled but also all of its
predecessors in the dependency graph as well.  This mechanism can be
overly pessimistic, because changes to one file might not have an
actual influence on subsequent compilations of dependent units.  CM
also recompiles a source whenever its own time stamp changes, but in
addition it compares the outcome with the result of previous
compilations of the same unit. Recompilation is terminated as soon as
changes no longer propagate any further.
<P>
Suppose we modify <TT>cml-version.sml</TT> without changing its
interface.  CM will recompile this unit and be done, because no
further work is necessary, while <TT>make</TT> would also process three
other files--<TT>cml-base.sml</TT>, <TT>cml.sml</TT>, and <TT>build.sml</TT>.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
3 Getting started</A>
</H1>
<P>
The easiest way of getting started using CM is by treating the entire
program--the ``system''--as one single group.  A group in its most
basic form is just a collection of SML source files, which must be
listed in an entity description file.
<P>
Even though there will be more on syntax and semantics of entity
description files, for now it is enough to start with two keywords:
<B>Group</B> and <B>is</B>, followed by a list of source file names.
For example, if we want to put <TT>main.sml</TT>, <TT>table.sig</TT>, and
<TT>table.sml</TT> into a single entity, then we must create a file <TT>
sources.cm</TT> containing:
<P><PRE>
Group is
        main.sml    (* the application code *)
        table.sig   (* interface to `table' abstraction *)
        table.sml   (* implementation of `table' abstraction *)
</PRE>
<P>
As shown in this example it is possible to use SML-style comments
within entity description files.
<P>
Once <TT>sources.cm</TT> has been set up we can start CM, which is
usually done by running the command <TT>sml-cm</TT>.  This begins an
interactive SML/NJ session and provides CM's functionality.
<P>
The command
<P><PRE>
CM.make ();
</PRE>
<P>
will now analyze the dependencies among components of the system,
determine a feasible ordering of (re-)compilation steps, and continue
to carry them out as necessary.  All CM commands are just SML
expressions.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">
4 Restrictions</A>
</H1>
<P>
Without placing certain restrictions on SML source code it is a
provably hard problem to perform reliable dependency analyses.
Therefore, CM can only deal with SML source code that obeys
the following two additional rules:

<P><UL>
<LI> No symbol can be defined (at top level) in more than one source
of the same entity (group or library).
<LI> The use of <TT>open</TT> is not allowed at the top level.
</UL>

<P>
It must also be noted that only occurrences of structures, signatures,
functors, and functor signatures are tracked by CM's dependency
analysis.  This in itself does not impose another restriction on the
admissible input language, but it bears the danger of missing certain
dependencies.  Good programming style demands keeping all other
definitions inside structures and signatures--in which case there
will be no problem.
<P>
The analyzer does not make any attempt to take side-effects into
account.  Consider the following situation:
<P>
File <TT>a.sml</TT> defines:
<PRE>
(* file a.sml *)
structure A = struct
  val r = ref 0
end
</PRE>
<P>
Execution of <TT>b.sml</TT> modifies the <TT>ref</TT> cell:
<P><PRE>
(* file b.sml *)
structure B = struct
  val _ = A.r := 1
end
</PRE>
<P>
Now, if <TT>c.sml</TT> refers to <TT>A.r</TT> as well - which value should
it see?
<P><PRE>
(* file c.sml *)
structure C = struct
  val x = !A.r
end
</PRE>
<P>
Either <TT>0</TT> or <TT>1</TT> would be legal, and there is no way to
prefer one over the other.
<P>
Care must be taken with top-level side effects, because CM does not
try to address this problem.  It is up to the programmer to make sure
that the ordering of side-effects is either unambiguous or does not
matter.  In the example above, to make sure that <TT>b.sml</TT> is
compiled and executed before <TT>c.sml</TT>, one could add an otherwise
unnecessary reference to structure <TT>B</TT> to the code in <TT>c.sml</TT>:
<P><PRE>
(* file c.sml *)
structure C = struct
  local
    structure B = B
  in
    val x = !A.r
  end
end
</PRE>
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION00050000000000000000">
5 Hierarchical modularity</A>
</H1>
<P>
Instead of using a single group one can divide a system into several
groups and arrange them into a group hierarchy.  There are two main
motivations for doing so:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>to make large systems more manageable by grouping related source
files together
<DT>2.
<DD>to relax the restriction of only being allowed to have one
definition for every top-level symbol
</DL>

The second point deserves some elaboration: Normally--within one
entity--we are forced to have at most one top-level definition for
each symbol.  Without this restriction there could be ambiguities that
prevent automatic dependency analysis from succeeding.
<P>
However, the hierarchy of groups must be specified by the programmer
explicitly. Therefore, there is no problem with having the same symbol
defined in different groups or libraries, because the partial ordering
for them is known in advance; CM does not have to infer it.
<P>
In SML it is not allowed for definitions to form cycles across module
boundaries.  In particular, <TT>structure A</TT> from <TT>a.sml</TT> cannot
refer to <TT>structure B</TT> in <TT>b.sml</TT>, if at the same time <TT>
structure B</TT> refers to <TT>structure A</TT>.  CM enforces this rule even
if there is a sub-entity providing definitions for either <TT>A</TT> or
<TT>B</TT>.  This would allow one to break the cycle, but in general it is
not possible to unambiguously decide where.
<P>
There is one exception.  Constructions like
<PRE>
structure A = A
</PRE>
or variations thereof, which seem to form cycles of length one, are
not considered cyclic definitions.  The use of <TT>A</TT> is
not in the scope of the definition of <TT>structure A</TT>.  There is no
way of changing this situation by reordering source files, because
both use and definition are in the same compilation unit.  Therefore,
CM will treat the use of <TT>A</TT> as a reference to some
definitions imported from a sub-entity.
<P><H2><A NAME="SECTION00051000000000000000">
5.1 Groups and subgroups</A>
</H2>
<P>
A group whose description file has been mentioned in some other
entity's description becomes a subgroup of that other entity, which is
then called the client of the group.  Sources of the client can refer
freely to any of the symbols defined within and exported by the
subgroup.  However, the client can also provide new definitions for
any of the subgroup's symbols, thereby masking the original one.
<P>
Imported symbols are available for re-export by the client.  The exact
rules which govern re-export will be described later after libraries
and export filters have been introduced.  So far we only deal with
groups and subgroups without export filters.  In this simple but
certainly common scenario all imported definitions will always be
re-exported--with the exception of those that have been masked.  In
effect, all non-masked definitions will ultimately become available at
the interactive top level.
<P><H2><A NAME="SECTION00052000000000000000">
5.2 Describing a group-hierarchy</A>
</H2>
<P>
To turn a group into a client of some other group one only needs to
mention the subgroup's description file somewhere among the list of
sources of the client.  From now on we will refer to this list as the
list of members.  Some of the members are sources, others are
descriptions for sub-entities.  Usually CM will automatically identify
description files in its member list by looking at the names: those
ending in <TT>.cm</TT> are treated as names of CM-style entity
description files.  Relative filenames are regarded as being relative
to the directory the description file appears in.
<P>
Suppose we have a group consisting of <TT>a.sml</TT> and <TT>b.sml</TT>,
which needs to refer to a subgroup containing <TT>util/c.sml</TT> and
<TT>util/d.sml</TT>.  In this case we could create a description file
<TT>util/sources.cm</TT> with:
<P><PRE>
Group is
        c.sml
        d.sml
</PRE>
<P>
and another one--called <TT>sources.cm</TT>--specifying:
<P><PRE>
Group is
        a.sml
        b.sml
        util/sources.cm
</PRE>
<P><H2><A NAME="SECTION00053000000000000000">
5.3 Tools and member classes</A>
</H2>
<P>
Sometimes a member file is not a description file and also does not
contain SML source code.  Such a file requires a different kind of
processing before CM's analyzer can understand them.  The special
processing is done by the built-in tools facility of CM, which in many
cases will invoke auxiliary programs for this purpose.  For
example, an ML-Yacc source file <TT>parser.grm</TT> will first be fed to
<TT>ml-yacc</TT>, which produces two files: <TT>parser.grm.sig</TT> and <TT>
parser.grm.sml</TT>.  These will then be treated as SML source files.
<P>
CM tools can be combined into cascades.  Instead of specifying <TT>
parser.grm</TT> one can use the corresponding RCS archive <TT>
parser.grm,v</TT> instead.  CM will first run the <TT>co</TT> command to
check out a copy of <TT>parser.grm</TT>, then feed the result into
ML-Yacc to finally obtain <TT>parser.grm.sig</TT> and <TT>
parser.grm.sml</TT>.
<P>
Normally the decision of which tool to pick is made based on the name
of the source file, but in general it can also be guided by explicit
specifications in the description file: Any member name can  optionally
be followed by a colon and the name of a member class.
Currently CM knows about the classes <TT>Sml</TT>, <TT>CMFile</TT>,
<TT>SCGroup</TT>, <TT>SCLibrary</TT>, <TT>MLLex</TT>, <TT>MLYacc</TT>, <TT>
MLBurg</TT>, <TT>RCS</TT>, and <TT>Noweb</TT>. Class names are case-insensitive.
<P>
Some class names are special to CM--they correspond to
classes of members which do not need to be processed by tools but
which can be analyzed directly.  Those classes are

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Sml:</STRONG>
<DD>plain SML sources
<DT><STRONG>CMFile:</STRONG>

<P>
Any entity can be equipped with an export filter.  The filter, which
is simply a list of symbols, restricts the set of definitions
exported.  Entities with export filters will export definitions for
precisely the symbols listed, no matter whether they are defined in the
entity itself or in one of the sub-entities that it is a client of.
<P>
Export filters can be used to good effect in the case of libraries,
where they are mandatory.  But even for groups they are often useful.
Symbols used for the communication between individual sources of an
entity but not meant to be visible from outside can conveniently be
hidden this way.  Furthermore, export filters enable us to reduce the
chance of clashes between different definitions for the same symbol.
Another reason for using export filters is to restrict the set of
symbols that will become visible at the interactive top level.
<P>
During the process of recompilation CM always combines just the
minimal set of static environments sufficient to build a suitable
compilation environment for each given SML source.  By specifying
export filters it is possible to further decrease the size of the
compiler's internal data structures, which is something that can also
contribute to reduced memory bandwidth and increased compilation
speed.
<P>
An export filter is specified as a list of symbols. It appears
between the keywords <TT>Group</TT> (or <TT>Library</TT>) and <TT>is</TT>.
Since in SML we distinguish between symbols of different name spaces
we must write <TT>structure</TT> <EM>struct-sym</EM> for a structure symbol,
<TT>signature</TT> <EM>sig-sym</EM> for a signature symbol, <TT>functor</TT>
<EM>fct-sym</EM> for a functor symbol, and <TT>funsig</TT> <EM>fsig-sym</EM>
for a functor signature symbol.
<P>
A group description with export filter could therefore look like this:

<P><PRE>

        structure Table
        signature TABLE
        structure Main
        functor A

</PRE>

<P><H2><A NAME="SECTION00055000000000000000">
5.5 Libraries</A>
</H2>
<P>
Entities are either groups or libraries.  In many ways libraries
are very similar to groups: both of them have a list of members, both
of them contain SML sources and input for tools, and both of them can
be clients to sub-entities.  The major difference between groups and
libraries becomes apparent when we look at the terms and conditions
under which symbols are exported.
<P>
If an entity imports a symbol from a group, then the corresponding
definition (besides being allowed to be masked) has the same status
as any definition coming directly from a source of the client.  In
particular, it will be exported to clients of the client unless hidden
by the client's export filter.
<P>
Symbols imported from libraries can be referred to from within sources
of the client, but they will not automatically be re-exported to
clients of the client.  (The client may still provide new definitions,
therby masking the ones that are imported.)  Since libraries never
appear at the root of the entity hierarchy this implies that
definitions from libraries will not become visible at the interactive
top level.  (The root entity is always treated as if it were a
group--regardless of what the description says.  This way the
programmer can force a library to be compiled, or to be loaded into
the top-level environment.)
<P>
Of course, this behavior can be modified: even symbols from libraries
are subject to re-export provided they have been mentioned in the
client's export filter explicitly.
<P>
Here is the precise rule which governs symbol export:
<P><DL>
<DT><STRONG>An entity with export filter</STRONG>
<DD>exports all symbols listed in the
filter regardless of their origin.
<DT><STRONG>A group without export filter</STRONG>
<DD>exports all symbols defined in
sources of the group and all symbols defined in subgroups of the group
unless these imported symbols have been redefined and therefore are
hidden.
<DT><STRONG>A library without export filter</STRONG>
<DD>is normally not legal.
However, for the purpose of backward-compatibility with SC it is
possible to use SC-style libraries which do not have export
filters.  In this case the library exports all symbols defined in
sources of the library and all non-masked symbols defined in
subgroups of the library. (This coincides with the rule for
groups without export filter.)
</DL>
<P>
If a symbol's definition is not used by any of the clients of a
library, then it cannot be accessed at all.  CM will ignore the
members of libraries whose exported definitions are not accessed; they
will not be loaded and they will not be linked with the rest of the
system.  Therefore, they behave in a way similar to members of
libraries for other languages.

<P><H3><A NAME="SECTION00056300000000000000">
5.6.3 Path name syntax and portability</A>
</H3>
<P>
Normally, pathnames are parsed according to CM's own ``standard''
interpretation.  Forward- or back-slashes (<B><code>/</code></B> and <B>
<code>\</code></B>) are used to separate directory names from names of files
and subdirectories.  Pathnames that start with a slash are absolute
pathnames, others are relative to the directory that contains the CM
description file.
<P>
These conventions are independent of the underlying operating system
and should work wherever there is a hierarchically structured file
system.
<P>
Pathnames specified using a string enclosed in double-quotes are
considered native and will be interpreted according to the underlying
operating system's conventions.  Therefore, such pathnames are
inherently non-portable.  However, this syntax is mainly used in
situations that are not portable to begin with:  explicit volume
labels under MS-DOS, non-standard characters in file names, and so on.
<P>
The recommended strategy for writing portable CM descriptions is to
exclusively use relative pathnames in CM's standard syntax.  By
relying on CM's built-in search path, libraries in central locations
(which would normally require the use of absolute pathnames) can be
named using simple file names.

Dependency analysis is also expensive, because it requires parsing
source files.  However, very little information taken from each source
is necessary to drive the analysis.  Therefore, CM extracts this
information and caches it both in main memory and in the file system.

The files used for this purpose are called dependency files.  They are
stored in a subdirectory <TT>CM/DEPEND</TT>.  For example, the declfile
for <TT>u/a.sml</TT> will be <TT>u/CM/DEPEND/a.sml</TT>.

In the presence of caches it is possible to overcome the absence of
source files as long as the contents of those caches are usable.  In

then CM might not need to consult the corresponding source file at
all.
<P>
However, there are situations where the source must be consulted
regardless of whether the binfile exists or not, because the binfile
also depends on the environment that was in effect when the source was
compiled.  This environment was the result of compiling the source's

environment also require the source to be recompiled.

<P>
A stable entity is one whose development has (tentatively) come to
some conclusion.  If we do not expect an entity to change in the near
future, then we may decide to stabilize it.  Examples of stable
entities are central libraries, which are installed and maintained by
the system administator.
<P>
After an entity has been stabilized we can be sure that binfiles will
always be valid.  The process of stabilization also creates a special
version of a dependency file--the stablefile--which contains a
summary of what would have been stored in per-source dependency files.
<P>
When CM encounters a stablefile it assumes the entity to be stable.
It will not be necessary for any of the sources to be present.  Not
even individual dependency files are necessary anymore.  Only
stablefile and binfiles are required.
<P>
For stable entities CM avoids most of its usual activity in the
ambient file system. On computers with comparatively slow access to
the file system this can considerably improve performance.  On many
systems it will make no difference.
<P>
The name of the stablefile is derived from the entity's description
file name.  A rule very similar to the one used for binfiles is used.
For example, on a Sparc-based U<font size=-1><small>NIX</small></font> system the stablefile for an

Most actions of CM are driven by the result of some dependency
analysis.  In order to perform such an analysis it is necessary to
know the root entity of the hierarchy to be analyzed.  The explicit
argument used by many functions for naming the root description file
is a string.  Normally it will be considered a CM-style description
file except if it ends in <TT>.sc</TT>, in which case it will be treated
as an SC-style description.
<P>
Most of the time we can rely on built-in defaults.  All functions in
the <TT>CM</TT> structure that take an explicit root description as one
of their arguments have a counterpart without such a parameter.  The
counterpart implicitly uses an internal default parameter of the form
<PRE>

The <TT>rootfile</TT> reference cell is not directly accessible, but
its value can be set via

operating system environment variable <code>CM_ROOT</code> is set, in which
case its value will be used.  Note, that <TT>!rootfile</TT> is always
treated as a CM-style description file--regardless of its name.
<P>
The names of all functions taking explicit string arguments end
with an apostrophe.  Names of the corresponding set of functions,
which make use of the default, are almost the same--they just omit
the trailing apostrophe.  Example:

<LI> the binfile is missing
<LI> the binfile is older than its source file
<LI> a file that this source depends on has been recompiled and
CM has discovered that the new version of the ancestor is not
compatible with the existing binfile
</UL>

<P>
The last point is important: Unlike <TT>make</TT> in U<font size=-1><small>NIX</small></font>, CM is
often able to avoid recompiling certain units even if their ancestors
had been recompiled.
<P>
If the result of the ancestor's compilation is still compatible with
the existing binfile, then no further action is necessary.  In
particular, just <TT>touch</TT>ing a file does not cause a recompilation
of the entire system.  Also, if a change to a source file does not
change the interface (the static environment) exported by the
compilation unit, then it will not trigger subsequent recompilations
of dependent files.  Such a behavior is sometimes referred to as
cutoff recompilation.
<P><TT>CM.recompile()</TT> does not execute the code of any of the units
and does not introduce any new bindings to the interactive top level.
Furthermore, it does not keep compiled code in main memory to avoid
wasting resources.
<P><TT>CM.make()</TT> performs the same analysis and recompilation steps
which would have been performed by <TT>CM.recompile()</TT>.  In addition
to that it executes the code in all units (i.e., not only the
ones which needed to be recompiled). If everything went without
error, then it will also augment the interactive top level with new
bindings for the symbols exported by the system.
<P><H3><A NAME="SECTION00082100000000000000">
8.2.1 Compilation errors</A>
</H3>
<P>
Obviously, when faced with an error during one of the compile steps,
CM cannot proceed with compiling other files that depend on the one
with the error.  However, this does not affect unrelated branches of
the dependency graph.  Therefore, CM can ``keep going'', which
is reminiscent of the behavior of <TT>make</TT> in U<font size=-1><small>NIX</small></font> when
it is called with the <TT>-k</TT> command line flag.
<P>
Calling
<P><PRE>
val keep_going: bool option -&gt; bool
</PRE>
<P>
with an argument of <TT>SOME true</TT> will enable this feature.
<P>
Since CM needs to run tools and parse source files before it can
even start to build the dependency graph it cannot keep going
after errors during any of those operations.  Until the set of
dependencies is available, it is impossible to decide which
branches of the graph will not be affected by an error.
<P><H2><A NAME="SECTION00083000000000000000">
8.3 Linearization</A>
</H2>
<P>
Export filters and CM's special rules for exporting symbols from
libraries add something new to programming in SML: It is possible to
construct systems that can be compiled using CM, but which have no
legal ordering of <TT>use</TT>-commands for the individual source files
that would build a semantically equivalent program.
Example:
<P>
Suppose we have two source files--<TT>f1.sml</TT> and <TT>
f2.sml</TT>--each of which defines two structures <TT>A</TT> and <TT>B</TT>.
In <TT>g.sml</TT> we want to access the <TT>A</TT> which was defined in <TT>
f1.sml</TT> and at the same time the <TT>B</TT> from <TT>f2.sml</TT>.  But no
matter how we order <TT>f1.sml</TT> and <TT>f2.sml</TT>--the definitions in
the second will always mask both definitions in the first.
Under CM we can put <TT>f1.sml</TT> and <TT>f2.sml</TT> into different
subgroups and use export filters to avoid the unwanted masking.
<P>
Nevertheless, in many cases things are not that convoluted and one can
use a topologically sorted list of source files for this
purpose.
<PRE>
val names': string -&gt; string list
val names: unit -&gt; string list

val binfiles': string -&gt; string list
val binfiles: unit -&gt; string list

val strings': string -&gt; string list
val strings: unit -&gt; string list
</PRE>
Each function--<TT>CM.names</TT>, <TT>CM.binfiles</TT>, and <TT>
CM.strings</TT>--returns a list of strings that is topologically sorted
according to the same principle.  <TT>CM.names</TT> produces lists of SML
source file names, <TT>CM.binfiles</TT> returns lists of binfile names,
and calls to <TT>CM.strings</TT> yield lists of descriptions for SML
sources.  These descriptions are often just the file name--except
when the SML source is the result of running some tool, in which case
this fact will be mentioned in the description. (The string argument
to <TT>names'</TT>, <TT>binfiles'</TT>, and <TT>strings'</TT> is the name of
the description file.)
<P>
Let <I>S</I>(<I>s</I>) be the SML source associated with string <I>s</I>.  The lists
returned by any of the three functions described above share the
property that if <I>s</I> and <I>t</I> are distinct members of the list and <I>s</I>
appears before (to the left of) <I>t</I>, then <I>S</I>(<I>s</I>) does not depend
(either directly or indirectly) on <I>S</I>(<I>t</I>).  This is what we mean when
we say the lists are in topological order.
<P><TT>CM.mkusefile</TT> allows one to create a file with a topologically
sorted list of <TT>use</TT> commands.  The second or sole string argument
is the name of the file to be written.
<PRE>
val mkusefile': string * string -&gt; unit
val mkusefile: string -&gt; unit
</PRE>
This can be useful for maintaining stand-alone versions of a system,
but the technique of sequentially reading and compiling a collection
of SML source files is inherently less expressive in its management of
name spaces than what can be done with CM's groups, libraries, and
export filters.
<P>
Therefore, a much better alternative to <TT>CM.mkusefile</TT> is <TT>
CM.sa</TT> (<I>sa</I> <IMG WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.gif"
 ALT="$\equiv$"> <I>S</I>tand <I>A</I>lone).  This function
also produces a small program expressed in SML source language that
can subsequently be read and compiled by SML/NJ.
<PRE>
val sa': string * string -&gt; unit
val sa: string -&gt; unit
</PRE>
However, unlike the program written by <TT>mkusefile</TT>, the one
generated using <TT>CM.sa</TT> uses special support that was built into
SML/NJ and reproduces precisely the same treatment of namespaces that
CM itself would use internally when running <TT>CM.make</TT>.
Furthermore, before compiling a source file the program will attempt
to load the corresponding binfile.  This can be a useful aid when
building systems that no longer depend on the presence of CM.  (CM
itself can be bootstrapped using this facility.)

Structure <TT>CM.Tools:&nbsp;CMTOOLS</TT> is a repository of types and
functions that are necessary when one wishes to add new tools to CM.
It is not necessary to recompile CM when augmenting it this way.
<P>
This interface for customizing CM is not as convenient as writing
scripts for <TT>make</TT>. Instead it was designed to be very general,
because the full power of SML can be used.  For the most common
situations there are useful pre-defined building blocks available in
<TT>CM.Tools</TT>.
<P><H2><A NAME="SECTION00091000000000000000">
9.1 Basics</A>
</H2>
<P>
Tools are associated with ``tool classes''.  Source files are
classified according to what tool is needed to process them.
<P>
CM's knowledge about a tool class consists of:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>A <EM>name</EM> for the class. This is a simple string consisting
of lower-case letters.
<DT>2.
<DD>A <EM>rule</EM>: The rule is a function from a member name (a
string) to a ``target'' list, where each target is another member name
together with an optional tool class. Most of the time member names
refer to files, but this is not always the case, as can be seen in the
case of the <EM>root</EM>@<EM>file</EM>.<TT>nw</TT> notation for the <TT>
noweb</TT> tool.
<DT>3.
<DD>A <EM>validator</EM>: The validator takes a source file name and
the target list as produced by the rule and determines whether or not
the tool needs to be invoked at all.
<DT>4.
<DD>A <EM>processor</EM>: The processor implements the actual tool,
i.e., it takes source file name and targets and runs the tool.
</DL>
<P><PRE>
type fname = string
type class = string
type target = fname * class option
</PRE>
<P>
Member names passed to rules, validators, and processors are exactly
the ones that appear in the entity description file.  Relative names
are resolved relative to the directory the description file appears
in. We call this directory the ``context''.  When running a validator
or a processor CM temporarily changes its working directory to the
context to allow for relative filenames to be processed correctly.
<P><PRE>
type validator = { source: fname, targets: target list } -&gt; bool
type processor = { source: fname, targets: target list } -&gt; unit
</PRE>
<P>
Ideally, rules should also run with the working directory changed to
the corresponding context.  However,  changing the working directory
can be relatively expensive and is often not necessary for a rule to
work correctly.  To account for that CM offers a somewhat involved
interface for its rules, so it is up to the programmer to decide
whether or not the context should be set or not.
<P><PRE>
type rulefn = unit -&gt; target list
type rulecontext = rulefn -&gt; target list
type rule = fname * rulecontext -&gt; target list
</PRE>
<P>
Generic rules take the name of the source and also a rule context as
an argument.  It may subsequently pass a parameterless procedure (the
``rule function'') to the rule context.  The function is then invoked
with the working directory set properly.  Rules that do not care about
the context can ignore their second argument.  Most of the time this
will be the case when the target file names can be derived directly
from the source name itself.  In more complicated situations it may be
that the rule needs to open the file and inspect its contents.
<P>
The most common rules (``simple rules'') will either always ignore the
context or always use it.  This is captured by the type <TT>
simplerule</TT>.  Conversion routines <TT>dontcare</TT> and <TT>withcontext</TT>
convert simple rules to generic ones.
<PRE>
type simplerule = fname -&gt; target list

val dontcare: simplerule -&gt; rule

Tools classes are registered with CM using the function <TT>

9.2 Tool classes and classification</A>

<P>
The tool class can be determined in three different ways:
<P><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>If the source name is a member in a CM description file, then it
can be followed by a colon and the name of the corresponding tool
class.  Internally, tool classes use lower-case names, tool names in
CM description files are case-insensitive.
<DT>2.
<DD>If a source is the product of running a tool on another source,
then the rule for that tool may have specified the tool class for its
target.
<DT>3.
<DD>If the description file omits the class specification or if a
tool's rule does not provide this information for one of its targets,
then CM tries to infer the class name automatically.

Automatic classification and classifiers</A>
</H3>
<P>
Automatic classification is done based on the name of the source.  In
the most common case it is the filename extension (``suffix'') that is
used to make the decision, but it is also possible to take more or all
of the file's name into account.  Classification is done by
``classifiers'', which come in two flavors:

<P><TT>CMB.make</TT>'s work proceeds in several distinct phases.  Most of
them are closely interrelated with the details of the interaction
between SML/NJ's compiler and its run-time system as well as with the
details of the boot procedure.
<P><H3><A NAME="SECTION000103100000000000000">
A.3.1 Phases</A>
</H3>
<P><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>Construction of the core environment by compiling some
dedicated source files located in the <TT>boot</TT> directory.
This step compiles three files, the names of which
are hardwired into <TT>CMB</TT>:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>boot/assembly.sig</STRONG>
<DD>defines a signature that describes the
interface to the run-time system. (The run-time system is not written
in SML.)
<DT><STRONG>boot/dummy.sml</STRONG>
<DD>implements a structure that matches the
run-time system's signature.  This structure is used as a placeholder
in order to allow further compile-steps to proceed.  The actual code
is never used, because the boot procedure will replace it with the
actual run-time system.
<DT><STRONG>boot/core.sml</STRONG>
<DD>implements the core environment.  This file
is the only one that directly depends on the result of compiling <TT>
boot/dummy.sml</TT>.  Since the place of the latter will be taken by the
run-time system we must compile <TT>boot/core.sml</TT> in a special way
to account for potential compatibility problems.
</DL>
<P><DT>2.
<DD>Compilation of the remaining sources in the boot directory in
some fixed order. This order is specified in <TT>boot/all-files.cm</TT>.
The format of this file is an entity description file. However, CM
does not perform dependency analysis but uses the order in which the
members are listed.
<DT>3.
<DD>CM reads the description file <TT>boot/pervasives.cm</TT> and
compiles the members listed there.  Anything defined here will
eventually make up the so-called pervasive environment, which serves
as the initial basis for compiling the compiler sources proper.
Now we have finished compiling the <TT>boot</TT> directory.
<DT>4.
<DD>Analysis of dependencies among the compiler's source files.  The
bulk of the compiler's sources can directly be understood by CM's
dependency analyzer.
<DT>5.
<DD>Recompilation of the compiler's sources as far as necessary.
This step also takes advantage of CM's basic functionality such as
cutoff recompilation. However, there are some differences:
<UL>
<LI> All binfiles are stored in one single directory. Its name
depends on target architecture and operating system.  For example,
when compiling for a DEC Alpha machine running a flavor of Unix
binfiles are placed into <TT>bin.alpha32-unix</TT>. Note that this
implies there can be <EM>no</EM> duplication of file names throughout the
compiler sources (even within subdirectories and subgroups).
<LI> The base environment for the compilation is the one constructed
by compiling the <TT>boot</TT> directory.
</UL>
<DT>6.
<DD>Generating list files (see below).
<A NAME="step:list">&#160;</A></DL><H3><A NAME="SECTION000103200000000000000">
A.3.2 List-files</A>
</H3>
<P>
In order to finally build a new SML/NJ system it is necessary to
combine the various binfiles.  However, this cannot be done by CM or
other SML programs.  The binfiles must be loaded into an empty
run-time system.
<P>
The boot mechanism of the run-time system reads certain list
files.  They are used to record the names of binfiles that are
needed to build a new compiler.  The two most important list
files--<TT>BOOTLIST</TT> and <TT>BINLIST</TT>--are written by the batch
compiler in step&nbsp;<A HREF="manual.html#step:list">6</A>.  Both of them (like all the other
list-files as well) are located in the binfile directory.
<P><TT>BOOTLIST</TT> contains the names of binfiles for the various sources
in the <TT>boot</TT> directory.  However, neither <TT>assembly.sig</TT> nor
<TT>dummy.sml</TT> are mentioned.
<P><TT>BINLIST</TT> lists all remaining binfiles necessary to build SML/NJ
on the target machine.  In order to create this file CM selects one
single compilation unit as the root of the dependency graph and writes
a topologically sorted list of binfiles belonging to nodes reachable
from this root.  The rootfile selected must define a structure whose
name depends on the target architecture.  It consists of <TT>Int</TT>
concatenated with the stem that can be looked up in
table&nbsp;<A HREF="manual.html#tab:structs">4</A>.  For example, for a target achitecture of
``MIPS big endian'' the structure's name is <TT>IntMipsBig</TT>. (<EM>
Int</EM> stands for <EM>Interactive</EM>.)

<P>
In addition to <TT>BINLIST</TT> there will be another list-file--<TT>
SRCLIST</TT>--naming the sources for these binfiles.  This file will be
used to find the sources in the case that static environments must be
re-created from sources at boot-time instead of simply extracting them
from binfiles (<TT>xmakeml -elab</TT> option).  Similarly, <TT>BOOTSRC</TT>
names the sources for binfiles listed in <TT>BOOTLIST</TT>. Note that
file names in <TT>BOOTLIST</TT> and <TT>BINLIST</TT> are relative to the
binfile directory, while file names in <TT>BOOTSRC</TT> and <TT>SRCLIST</TT>
are relative to the compiler's source directory.
<P>
Finally, there will be a set of list-files--one per supported target
architecture (table&nbsp;<A HREF="manual.html#tab:structs">4</A>)--which specify names of
binfiles for cross compilers.  Again, each of these files contains a
topologically sorted list of binfiles.  Their creation proceeds
completely analogous to creating <TT>BINLIST</TT>: There must be one
compilation unit defining some structure whose name depends on the
cross compiler's target architecture.  This unit is selected as the
root of the dependency graph used to produce the topological ordering.
To obtain the name of the structure CM concatenates the stem shown in
table&nbsp;<A HREF="manual.html#tab:structs">4</A> with <TT>VisComp</TT>.  Example:  The structure
pertaining to cross compilers for the HP-PA architecture is <TT>
HppaVisComp</TT>.

<P><DL>
<DT><STRONG>boot/all-files.cm</STRONG>

<DT><STRONG>all-files.cm</STRONG>

A.5 Cross-compilation and retargeting</A>
</H2>
<P>
Retargeting the batch compiler corresponds to creating a new
instance of <TT>CMB</TT>, the compiler of which has been replaced with
one that produces code for a different architecture.  In order to be
able to retarget we must already have a complete set of working
binfiles for the compiler running on the host architecture.
<P>
Structure <TT>CMR</TT> contains the <TT>retarget</TT> function, which is
responsible for building a new <TT>CMB</TT>.
<P><PRE>
structure CMR: sig
  val retarget: { bindir: string, cpu: string, os: string } -&gt; unit
end
</PRE>
<P>
For example, if the host machine is a DEC Alpha and we want to
cross-compile for a Sparc running some flavor of U<font size=-1><small>NIX</small></font>, then we
invoke:
<P><PRE>
CMR.retarget { bindir = &quot;bin.alpha32&quot;, cpu = &quot;sparc&quot;, os = &quot;unix&quot; };
</PRE>
<P>
This command reads <TT>bin.alpha32/BINLIST.sparc</TT> and loads the files
listed therein.  The result is a compiler that produces code for a
Sparc machine running U<font size=-1><small>NIX</small></font>, even though it itself still runs on the
Alpha.  The new compiler is used to construct a new structure <TT>
CMB</TT> which then replaces the old one.
<P>
Known CPU names are <TT>alpha32</TT>, <TT>sparc</TT>,
<TT>mipseb</TT>, <TT>hppa</TT>, <TT>rs6000</TT>, <TT>x86</TT>, and <TT>bytecode</TT>.
Operating system specifiers are <TT>unix</TT>, <TT>macos</TT>, <TT>os2</TT>,
and <TT>win32</TT>.
<P>
Once CMR.retarget has completed successfully it suffices to run
<P><PRE>
CMB.make ();

Normally a working version of CM will be distributed as part of the
SML/NJ system.  SML/NJ's installation procedure automatically builds
CM and even uses it to install other parts of the system.

B.2 Maintenance</A>

<P>
Once an initial version has been set up CM itself can be used
to maintain its own sources.  CM is an ordinary SML program.
It has been divided into three entities: the root group described in
<TT>sources.cm</TT>, a group defining the interface to the base system
described in <TT>sys/sources.cm</TT>, and a library of utility functions.
The library's description file is <TT>util/sources.cm</TT>.

After making changes to CM's sources it is advisable to run

CM from scratch should this become necessary in the future.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION000120000000000000000">
C Compatibility with SC</A>
</H1>
<P>
CM's precursor SC supported a notion of groups and
libraries similar to the one used here.  However, there was no way of
specifying export filters or explicit member classes.
<P>
Furthermore, the property of being a library was not given as part of
the entity's description.  SC's solution was to treat as
library description files those members whose names were preceded by a
minus sign.  This meant that the client had to know whether an entity
was a group or a library.  There was no syntactic difference between
group descriptions and library descriptions.
<P>
In most cases it is easy to convert from SC's description
files to a format suitable for CM.  In fact, in their most basic
form SC's and CM's descriptions look very similar to
each other.  To upgrade from the former to the latter simply add the
line
<PRE>
Group is
</PRE>
at the top of the description file and rename it from <TT>sources.sc</TT>
to <TT>sources.cm</TT>.
<P>
CM can also process SC-style description files directly.
It does this by introducing the member classes <TT>SCGroup</TT> and <TT>
SCLibrary</TT>.  By default, member names ending in <TT>.sc</TT> are regarded
as belonging to <TT>SCGroup</TT>.
<P>
Since it is impossible to use explicit class names within SC-style
description files CM will rely solely on name suffixes and the leading
minus sign to infer them.  The same set of rules given in
table&nbsp;<A HREF="manual.html#tab:suffixes">1</A> applies here.
<P>
The most serious deficiency of SC-style descriptions is that
they do not provide a notation for specifying export filters.  One
result of this is the undesirable ability to write libraries without
export filters--something that has deliberately been disallowed in
CM.
<P>
CM's current support for old-style SC descriptions must be regarded as
a temporary solution only.  It is expected to disappear in the future.
