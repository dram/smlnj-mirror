\section{Reserved words}
The following are reserved words.   They may not be used as
identifiers.  In this document the alphabetic reserved words are always
shown in boldface.
\begin{quote}

\tt

as case datatype else end exception do fn fun functor handle if in 
infix infixr let local nonfix of op open raise rec sharing sig signature
struct structure then type val while withtype orelse

\verb"{  }  [  ]  ,  ;  (  )  ->  *  |  :  ...  =  =>  #  _"
\end{quote}
The following are obsolete reserved words, which may not be used as
identifiers in some compilers:
\begin{quote}
\tt
\raggedright
overload exceptionx handlex raisex with \ \verb"||"\   ?
\end{quote}
\section{Literal constants}
An integer constant is any non-empty sequence of digits, possibly preceded
by a negation symbol (\verb|~|).

A real constant is an integer constant, possibly followed by a point (.)
and one or more digits, possibly followed by an exponent symbol(E) and
an integer constant; at least one of the optional parts must occur,
hence no integer constant is a real constant.  Examples: \verb|0.7| ,
\verb|~3.32E5| , \verb|3E~7| .  Non-examples: \verb|23| , \verb|.3| ,
\verb|4.E5| , \verb|1E2.0| .

A string constant is a sequence, between quotes (\verb|"|), of zero or more
printable characters, spaces, or escape sequences.  Each escape sequence
is introduced by the escape character \verb|\|, and stands for a character
sequence.  The allowed escape sequences are as follows (all other
uses of \verb|\| being incorrect):
\begin{tabular}{l p{3.9in}}
\verb|\n| & A single character interpreted by the system as end-of-line.\\
\verb|\t| & Tab. \\
\verb|\^c| & The control character c, for any appropriate c.\\
\verb|\ddd| &  The single character with ASCII code ddd (3 decimal digits).\\
\verb|\"| & The double-quote character (\verb'"'). \\
\verb|\\| &  The backslash character (\verb"\").\\
\verb|\f___f\| & This sequence is ignored, where f\_\_\_f stands for a
sequence of one or more formatting characters (a subset of the
non-printable characters including at least space, tab, newline,
formfeed).  This allows one to write long strings on more than one
line, by writing \verb"\" at the end of one line and at the start of the
next.
\end{tabular}

\section{Identifiers}

Identifiers are used to stand for 9 different classes of objects,
which occupy 6 different name spaces, as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item value variables (var), value constructors (con), exception constructors (exncon)
\item type variables (tyvar)
\item type constructors (tycon)
\item record labels (lab)
\item structures (str), functors (fct)
\item signatures (sgn)
\end{enumerate}
Thus, an identifier could not in the same scope stand for both a
value variable and a constructor, but an identifier can
be bound simultaneously to a type constructor and a signature.

To remove some ambiguity, it is recommended that constructors start
with an uppercase letter, and variables start with a lowercase
letter; but this is a convention, not an enforced rule  (it is
confounded, for example, by symbolic identifiers).

An identifier is either {\em alphanumeric}: any sequence of letters,
digits, primes ('), and underbars (\_) starting with a letter or a
prime, or {\em symbolic}: any sequence of the following symbols
\begin{quote}
\verb"! % & $ + - / : < = > ? @ \ ~ \^ | # * `"
\end{quote}
In either case, however, reserved words are excluded.  This means
that for example \verb"_" and \verb"|" are not identifiers, but
\verb"also_ran" and \verb"|=|" are identifiers.

A type variable (tyvar) may be any alphanumeric identifier starting
with a prime.  The other eight classes (var, con, tycon, ...)
are represented by identifiers not starting with a prime.  The class
lab is also extended to include the numeric labels 1, 2, 3, ... .

Type variables are therefore disjoint from the other classes.
Otherwise, the class of an occurrence of an identifier is determined
from context.

Spaces or parentheses are sometimes needed 
to separate symbolic identifiers and reserved words.  Two examples are

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}
\verb"a:= !b" &or& \verb"a:=(!b)" &but not& \verb"a:=!b"\\
\verb"~ :int->int" &or& \verb"(~):int->int" &but not& \verb"~:int->int"
\end{tabular}

These punctuation characters cannot be constituents of identifiers
and therefore never need spaces around them:
\begin{quotation}
\verb| " ( ) , . ; [ ] { } |
\end{quotation}

\section{Comments}
A comment is a character sequence (outside of a string)
within comment brackets (* *) in which comment brackets are properly
nested.

\section{The bare syntax}
The Standard ML bare language is obtained by stripping the full
language of any {\em derived} forms (those that may be defined in
terms of other constructs in the language), and of any constructs
related to the module system.  The bare language will be explained
in Chapters \ref{eval} and \ref{types},
and successive chapters describe augmentations
of it that yield the full language.

Figure~\ref{bare} shows the syntax of the bare language.  The notation
\begin{quotation}
phrase x \rep{k} x phrase
\end{quotation}
indicates the repetition of the {\em phrase} at least $k$  times,
separated by the punctuation character $x$.
