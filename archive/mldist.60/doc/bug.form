Bug reports are most useful if you can narrow down the cause of the bug
to as small a fragment of code as possible.  Also, please check src/doc/bugs
to see if your bug is already known.  Suggestions on how to improve the 
compiler are also welcome, even if they don't identify a specific bug.  
Examples of unhelpful error messages are also useful.

Send bug reports to macqueen@research.att.com.
