\chapter{Introduction}

This is a preliminary draft of a reference manual
for Standard ML of New Jersey, an implementation of the Standard ML language.
Our implementation adheres closely to the Standard ML language definition
\footnote{see {\it The Definition of Standard ML, version 3}, by Robert Harper,
Robin Milner, and Mads Tofte, technical report ECS-LFCS-89-81, Dept. of
Computer Science, Univ. of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH9~3JZ Scotland.}
except that the library of built-in functions is larger and better 
organized.

The document at present has many gaps.  It should be treated
as a guide to the 1989 pre-release, rather than as a complete
reference manual.
