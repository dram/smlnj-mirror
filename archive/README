SML/NJ Early Versions from DBM's 9-track tapes
  Pontis Systems in Chicago attempted to recover contents of nine 9-track tapes
  from Bell Labs around October 2012. Some contents was extracted from 7 of the 9 tapes.
  Most of the content is early versions of SML/NJ (1,2,3,4,5,6,11,22,35,36), but there
  are also copies of source code for Cardelli's compilers (1984) and Edinburgh
  Standard ML (1985).
  
Tape1.zip
Directory 36, containing SML/NJ Version 0.36, 4 July 1989 (renamed mlsave.36 for consistency).
  src appears to be complete.

Tape2.zip
Directory mlsave.22, containing mo.cps, mo.vax, and src.  (SML/NJ Version 0.22, 18 Oct 1988?)
  src is incomplete (only absyn, basics, bignums, boot). mo contains object files corresponding
  to the original source files, including those that are missing.  Tape contents
  were probably truncated.
  This may be the first version distributed outside BL/Princeton (or possibly Version 11 was first).

Tape3.zip
Directory "tape3 2" (renamed tape3).  Contains:
  dbm : dbm home directory snapshot, Dec 1986 (dates range from Aug 83 to Dec 86)

    as well as pscr, Pascal source for "ML under VAX" (dated April/May 84),
    BL ML course in Sept 83.
