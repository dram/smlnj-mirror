Master Bug List, Standard ML of New Jersey as of June 26, 1991.
Most of these bugs have been fixed; these are all bugs ever reported.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Identifier as functor body (dbm)
Problem: 
  Using a parameter structure variable as the body of a functor yields an
  error message.
Code:
   functor F(structure A: sig end) = A
Messages:
   Error: unbound structure id: A
Comment:
Status: fixed in 0.20, along with some related bugs involving lack of
  visibility of parameters on the rhs of functor declarations.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Mispelled nonnullary constructors in patterns
Problem: 
  Mispelling a constructor with arguments in a pattern leads to misleading
  error messages.
Version: 0.18
Code:  (in typing/typecheck.sml)
      ...
	       app genType rvbs
	   end
       | EXCEPTIONdec(ebs) =>
	   let fun checkWeak(VARty(ref(UNBOUND id))) = 
		     if tyvarWeakness id > abs
		     then condemn "type variable in exception type too strong"
      ...
Status: Fixed in 0.50
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Redefining an open structure at top level
Problem:
  It appears that redeclaration of an opened structure S releases the
  runtime binding of S, even though we can still refer to its component
  x.  We get the effect of a kind of dangling reference.  Need to avoid
  reclaiming S if S is open at the point where it is redeclared.
Version: 0.18
Code:
    - structure S = struct datatype t = A val x = A end;
    structure S : <sig>
    - S.x;
    val it = A : S.t
    - open S;
    open S
    - x;
    val it = A : t
    - type t = bool;
    type t = bool
    - x;
    val it = A : S.t
    - structure S = struct end;
    structure S : <sig>
    - x;
    uncaught exception Intmap
    - 
Comment:
  Need to detect the fact that a structure has been opened at the top level
  and if so it's lvar binding should not be deleted from the top-level environment.
Status: fixed in 0.20.  top level opens copy bindings into top level environment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. duplicate specifications not checked
Problem:
  No checking for duplicated specifications in signatures.
Version: 0.18
Comment:
  This should be done when building the signature symbol table.
  See bug 81.  (elg)
Status: open
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. exportML environment
Problem:
  Subtle bug in exportML: it exports the environment of the person who
  originally booted the system, and this environment is restored when
  the image is started up.  This effects system, execute, and
  subsequent exportML's.  On startup, exportFN destroys the environment
  and command-line args, and this too could have adverse effects on
  those functions.
Version: 0.18
Status: fixed in version 0.31
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. open file descriptors
Problem:
  File descriptors open in the ML system remain open on a call of system.
Version: 0.18
Comment:
  I haven't decided what I want to do about this yet.  We
  might like only stdin, stdout, and stderr to remain open.
  Note that if the parent closes one of them, it will be closed in the
  child as well (it inherits them rather than getting new ones).
  Note that
	  ioctl(fd,FIOCLEX,(void *)0)
  will cause a file descriptor to be closed on an exec.  This could be
  called after each open (but shouldn't be called on pipes).
  Another possibility is just to leave them all open.
Status: not a bug, reflects Unix semantics
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. constructor representation
Problem:
  There is a bug involving constructor representation.  The compiler
  examines the structure of a datatype and tries to determine an efficient
  runtime representation for it.  For example, for the list datatype, nil
  can be represented as an integer, and :: can just be a pointer to its
  tuple argument (integers and tuples are distinct).  This fails in our system
  at the structure level.  For example:
Version: 0.18
Code:
    signature S = sig
	type 'a t
	datatype 'a list = nil | :: of 'a t
    end
    structure A : S = struct
	datatype 'a list = nil | :: of 'a * 'a list
	withtype 'a t = 'a * 'a list
    end
Comment:
  Here the compiler can deduce the efficient representation for the
  (local) list datatype in structure A; but this cannot be deduced in
  the signature S (an object of type 'a t might not be a pointer).
Status: An error message is now generated (0.54) when this occurs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. interactive error recovery
Problem:
  In the interactive mode, parser error recovery should be suppressed
  (but isn't); the parser may continue to look for input after an error,
  when the user would expect to be back at top level.
Version: 0.18
Status: Fixed in 0.52
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. behavior at limits (e.g. stack overflow)
Problem:
  The behavior of the system when it reaches limits is sometimes bizarre.
  For instance, on a Sun, if the system runs out of stack space it
  will die with "Illegal instruction".  This is because the signal can't
  be handled since the stack is full.  A possible fix would be to use a
  separate stack to handle signals, but the handler would have to be
  smart, since SIGSEGV would be raised.  Note that the stack limit can
  be changed with the limit command; and hopefully this particular bug will
  disappear with the next version of the code generator.
Version: 0.18
Status: fixed in version 0.31
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. exhaustiveness messages at top-level
Problem: Top level bindings should not report on exhaustiveness, but they do.
Version: 0.18
Status: Not important.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. poor error messages [parser]
Problem: Poor error message (parens are needed around the hd::tl pattern):
Version: 0.18
Code:
   -  fun f hd::tl = 4;
Messages:
    Error: expected EQUAL, found ID (::)
    Error: expected nonfix-identifier, found ID ::
    Error: unbound variable bogus
    Error: type error: operator and operand don't agree
    operator : ((wrong*wrong list) -> wrong list)
    operand : (wrong*('aA list -> 'aA list))
    expression:
      bogus :: tl
    - 
Comment:
  The "unbound variable bogus" in particular is confusing.
Status: Fixed in 0.52.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. loss of information in value printing
Problem:
  When printing values formed using constructors created by functor application,
  the argument type of the constructor can sometimes be lost, resulting in
  inability to print the value accurately.
Version: 0.18
Code:
	- functor F(type t) =
	= struct
	=   datatype r = C of t
	= end;

	- structure S = F(type t = int);

	- S.C 3;
  [1]   val it = C - : S.r

  But
  	- signature SS = sig type t datatype r = C of t end;

        - structure S = struct type t = int  datatype r = C of t end;

	- S.C;
	val it = fn : ?.t -> S.r

	- S.C 3;
	val it = C 3 : S.r

  and
	- structure S': SS = struct type t = int  datatype r = C of t end;
	- S'.C;
	val it = fn : ?.t -> S'.r
	- S'.C 3;
	val it = C 3 : S'.r

Comments:
  Printing the argument type of C at [1] yields "IND/1/", indicating that
  the type of C contains an indirection that is not interpreted in context.
  It does not seem possible to recover the context from the structure S, because
  there is no simple way to get back from the type S.r or the DATACON C to the 
  structure environment.  This may be a reason for having type constructors
  contain a pointer to their home structure rather than just the symbolic
  path.  Another alternative would be to follow the path in S.r to find the
  structure S so that we can use it as context for the type of C.
Status: fixed in 0.58
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. printing of types from abstraction structure
Problem:
  Printing of types from an abstraction is not quite right.
Code: (test/sigs/test7)
    signature FOO = 
    sig
       type T1 and T2
       val x1: T1 and x2: T2
       sharing type T1 = T2
    end

    abstraction Foo: FOO =
    struct
       datatype T1 = CON
       type T2 = T1
       val x1 = CON and x2 = CON
    end

    [Foo.x1,Foo.x2];
Messages:
    [-,-] : ?.T1   (* should be Foo.T1 *)
Status: Fixed in 0.56
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14. Bad printing of list values
Problem: list values printed with :: instead of [...]
Version:
Code:
    datatype Foo = FOO of int list
    val it = FOO [1, 2, 3]
Messages:
    FOO (1 :: 2 :: 3 :: nil): Foo
Comments:
Status:
  Fixed in version 0.25.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. Error message
Problem: Unfortunate error message (I left out `type'):
Version: ?
Code: 
	- signature STWO = sig structure X:SIG and Y:SIG sharing X.t=Y.t end;
Messages:
	Error: bad path is sharing specification
Comments:
   (It's also misspelled.)
Status: fixed in 0.56
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16. "use" errors
Problem:
  Untidy interface to "use". "use" on a nonexistent file still prints the
  "[opening ...]" message and then raises Io_failure - shouldn't it just
  say "[cannot open ...]" or something?
Status: fixed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17. Inaccurate line numbers
Problem:
	Misleading line numbers for some things (eg. type errors in multi-line
	datatype declarations). Could the system print something like
	"Line 33ff", or a line range a la LaTeX, for these?
Status: fixed in 0.53
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18. Bad error messages for illegal record expression
Version: [< 0.16]
Problem:
	interesting diagnostic in the (meaningless) expression
Code:
	- {3};
Messages:
	Error: expected RBRACE, found INT
	Error: type error: operator and operand don't agree
	operator : unit
	operand : int
	expression:
	  () 3

	Error: declaration or expression expected, found RBRACE
Comment:
	What's the "() 3"?
Status: fixed in 0.53
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19. Exception declaration with ":"
Problem: This gives a type error rather than a syntax error: odd:
Version: ?
Code:
		- signature FOO = sig exception Foo of string end;

		- structure Foo: FOO = struct exception Foo: string end;
		                                       =-> ^ <-=
Messages:
		Error: Type in structure doesn't match signature
		name = Foo
		spec = (string -> exn)
		actual = exn
Comments:
  Without signature constraint ":FOO" in declaration of Foo you get a syntax
  error: "expected END, found COLON".  With the signature, you get the above
  type error but no complaint about the ":".
Status: fixed in 0.53
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20. "print" seems overloaded rather than polymorphic:
Problem: print is overloaded rather than being polymorphic
Version: -
Code:
	- datatype Foo = FOO1 | FOO2;
	- print FOO1;
Messages:
	Error: type error: no match for overloaded variable:
	print
Comments:
	according to the original SML report, both "print" and "makestring"
	should be polymorphic identity functions. In our compiler, "print"
	is correctly polymorphic. "makestring" is (incorrectly) overloaded,
	disallowing "makestring FOO1". Needless to say, I want to be able
	to do "makestring" on datatypes.
Status: not a bug
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21. Bad error recovery in the typechecker:
Problem:
Version: 0.15a
Code:
	- signature SIG = sig
	     exception Foo of int
	     val A: int
	     val B: int
	     val C: int
	  end;

	- structure S: SIG =
	     struct
		exception Foo: int
			     ^
		val A = 1
		val B = 2
		val C = 3
	     end
Messages:
	Error: Type in structure doesn't match signature
	name = Foo
	spec = (int -> exn)
	actual = exn
	Error: unmatched val spec: A
	Error: unmatched val spec: B
	Error: unmatched val spec: C
	^ there can be a lot of these!
Comments:
	Sometimes the exception error doesn't appear, just giving the unmatched
	spec errors, rather misleadingly.
Status: fixed in 0.53
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22. inherited environment of subprocesses
Problem:
  (one you know about) - subprocesses created via "execute" inherit
  the environment present when the ML system was built! Also: broken
  pipe errors should be caught and raise Io_failure?
Status: fixed in 0.31
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23. circularity in substructure relationship
Problem:
  No checking for circular sharing constraints.  Circular constraints cause
  unhandled Notfound_Table exception.
Code:
	- signature Sig =
	    sig
		structure D: sig
				structure E: sig end
			     end

		sharing D = D.E
	     end;
Messages:
	uncaught exception Notfound_Table
Comments:
  By the way - why is "sharing structure D = D.E" illegal above? (it
  dislikes the word "structure".)
  See bug 33. (elg)
Status:
  Not considered a bug (signature can't be matched, -- this property could
  be statically detected in the compiler, but isn't).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
24. incomplete write
Submitter: Nick
Comments:
	I'm trying to put in some bullet-proof error recovery into my
	subprocess software, so that "^C" at ML top-level doesn't
	confuse the daemon. What happens if an "output" operation is
	active when ^C is hit - does it do a partial write? I seem to be
	getting some buffer corruption somewhere, as a partial write is
	immediately followed by another complete write. It might make
	my life easier if "output" could be guaranteed atomic under "^C"
	(i.e. any single output operation will complete before Interrupt
	gets raised).
	   Just a thought. I'll perhaps put timers into the daemon and ML code
	so that they flush and restart properly - this may solve the problem.
Status: New signal-handling stuff in 0.56 makes this less important.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
25. parser vs grammar (?)
Problem: Parser doesn't accept "vb ::= rec rec vb".
Status: language problem
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
26. export ML within a use
Problem:
	Awkward behaviour when exportML is called while a file is being
	"use"'d - the saved state falls over with Io_failure. Shouldn't
	restarting clear the use stack?Version:
Status:
  Modified in version 18 so the image doesn't die.  It still raises
  Io_failure, though. (tyj)
  Fixed in 0.56

27. different numbers of arguments in curried clauses cause bogus type error
Version: 0.15
Code:
    fun compose [] = (fn x => x) |
	compose (f::fl) x = compose fl (f x);
Messages:
    Error: type error: rules don't agree
     expected: ('a list -> ('b -> 'b))
     found:
      (f :: fl,x) => compose fl (f x)

29. use_string in structure definition
Submitter: Nick
Date: 3/24/88
Version: 0.18
Problem: use_string can cause uncaught Intmap exception
Code:
    - structure Foo =
       struct
	  val x = use_stream(open_string "val _ = Foo.x;")
       end;
Messages:

31. redefining an open structure orphans r/t bindings
Submitter: John Reppy, jhr@svax.cs.cornell.edu
Date: 4/4/88
Version: 0.18
Problem:
    Redefining a structure after opening it makes its components inaccessible
    at runtime even though they are still visible, because the structure
    binding is removed from the r/t intmap environment.
Code:
    val it = () : unit
    - structure S = struct type t = int; val x = 1 end;
    structure S : <sig>
    - open S;
    open S
    - structure S = struct type t = bool; val x = true end;
    structure S : <sig>
    - x;

32. printing loops
Submitter: Andrew

Version: 0.18
Problem: printing a cyclic data structure involving a ref loops
Code:
    datatype A = B | C of A ref
    val x = C(ref B);
    val C y = x;
    y := x;
    x;

33. cyclical sharing not checked, parsing problem
Submitter: Mads
Date: 4/12/88
Version: 0.18
Problem: cyclical sharing not detected, but leads to parsing bug
Code:
    (1)

    signature Sig =
      sig structure a:
	    sig structure b: sig end
	    end
	  structure a': sig end sharing a = a'
	  structure b': sig end sharing b' = a.b
	  sharing a' = b'
      end

    This example should be rejected because it would lead to a cycle in 
    the signature for 'a' (the semantics Section 5.4). If one deletes the
    last sharing obtaining

    (2)

    signature Sig =
      sig structure a:
	    sig structure b: sig end
	    end
	  structure a': sig end sharing a = a'
	  structure b': sig end sharing b' = a.b
      end

    one get a legal program. However these examples do not survive
    parsing. (I get an "uncaught exception Notfound_Table"). Ignoring
    this, will your sharing algorithm cope with this subtlety?
Messages:
    uncaught exception Notfound_Table  (now fixed)
Comments:
    We may not try to find cycles, since they would in any case prevent
    the signature from matching any structure.  [dbm]

Submitter: Bob Harper
Date: 5/20/88
Version: 0.18
Problem:
   (1) missing substructures found in environment,
   (2) bind exception processing sig specs after missing substructure
Code:
    signature SIG = sig type t val x:t end;

    signature SIG' = sig structure S:SIG val y:S.t end;

    structure T : SIG = struct type t=int val x = 3 end;

    structure T' : SIG' = struct structure S=T val y=S.x end;

    (* This yields a sensible error message, then an uncaught exception Bind. *)
    structure T'' : SIG' = struct val y=T.x end;

    signature SIG'' = sig structure T:SIG val y:T.t end;

    (* This should not succeed, but it does!  The unbound structure appears
       in the global environment, so it doesn't notice that the substructure T
       is missing.
    *)
    structure U : SIG'' = struct val y = T.x end;
Messages:
Comments:
    (1) missing substructure was found because lookSTR was being used to
        look for structure components in SigMatch.realize.  Fixed by introducing
	lookSTRlocal that does not search through STRlayer.
    (2) TypesUtil.lookTycPath was causing bind exception because the missing
	substructure defaulted to the unexpected form INDstr(~1).  Caused
	lookTycPath to raise an exception that was caught by typeInContext,
	which then returns ERRORty.  SigMatch.compareTypes ignores the ERRORty.

43. incorrect error message for sharing constraints
Submitter: Bob Harper
Date: 5/21/88
Version: 0.18
Problem:
    "unbound structure id in sharing spec" error message was reporting the
    wrong structure id.
Code:
    signature SIG = sig end;

    signature SIG' = sig
      structure S:SIG
    end;

    (* Here it complains that S' is unbound in the sharing specification, but
    actually it's S'.T that is unbound! *)

    signature SIG'' = sig
      structure S':SIG'
      structure T:SIG
      sharing S'.T = T
    end;

45. equality on simple recursive datatype causes compiler to loop
Submitter: Dave
Date: 5/27/88
Version: 0.19
Problem:
  Compiling equality for a trivial recursive datatype causes the compiler
  to loop in Equal.equal.(test).
Code:
  datatype t = A of t
  fun f(x:t) = (x=x)
Comments:
  Of course this is a useless datatype, but someone could define it by mistake
  and cause the compiler to loop.  The problem is the treatment of datatypes
  with a single transparent constructor in the function test in equal.  It
  recursively calls test on the argument type of the constructor, which in this
  case is justs t again.  A datatype like

     datatype t = A of t * int

  does not cause the loop.
Status: fixed in 0.20
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
46. equality type checking and flexrecords
Submitter: Dave
Date: 6/3/88
Version: 0.20
Problem:
    when flexrecords are used a nonequality type may be accepted in a context
    where an equality record type is required
Code:
    fun f(r as {a,...},true) = (r = r)  (* checks only that a admits equality *)
      | f({b,...},false) = b 3 (* oops, the b field is a function! *)
Messages:
    val f = fn : {a:''a,b:int -> bool} * bool -> bool
    (* argument type is not an equality type *)
Comments:
    A fix probably requires a change in the way flexrecords are represented.
Status: fixed in 0.54.

47. scope of user bound type variable
Submitter: Mads Tofte (Edinburgh)
Date: 3/8/88
Version: 0.18
Problem:
  some uses of user-bound type variables have strange effects
Code:
  fun f(x) = let val y : 'a = x in y y end;
  val f = fn : 'a -> 'a
  - f 3;
Messages:
  Error: operator and operand don't agree (bound type var)
  operator domain: 'a
  operand:         int
  in expression:
    f 3
Comments:
  y gets the type !'a.'a, which allows the expression "y y" to type check
  x gets the user bound type variable 'a as its type and it is not generalized
   either when y's type is generalized or when f's type is generalized
  the result type 'a refers to a generically bound type variable which
   coincidentally is printed as 'a
Status: fixed in 0.20
  generates an error message indicating that the user-bound type variable was
  propagated out of its scope.  This is a rather obscure error message, but it
  is not easy to do better.  This seems much better that allowing the propagation
  of the user bound type variable out of its natural syntactic scope, since it
  would be necessary to do arbitrary amounts of type checking to simply determine
  whether two explicit type variables are the same.

48. printing of identity withtype declarations
Submitter: Dave
Date: 6/9/88
Version: 0.20
Problem:
  A simple identity declaration in the withtype clause of a datatype declaration
  will not be printed properly.
Code:
  datatype foo = A
  withtype t = int;
Messages:

Comments:
  This happens because the backpatching of the type constructor puts the new
  name in the defining type as well as in the defined type binding.

    Also, from Dave Berry (2/2/89):
    NJ ML prints the constructors of a datatype when that datatype is
    matched against a "type" in a signature, even if the signature
    doesn't include the constructors.

    This seems a trivial point (except that it's confusing for the novices on
    the course we teach).  However, with some complicated programs the compiler
    bombs out, raising the subscript exception.  You are left in the ML system,
    but it won't compile your code.

    I don't have a small example of this.  It first hit me preparing
    examples for the aforementioned course, and it's just hit me again.

79. withtype
Submitter: Simon (from abstract hardware) via Mike Fourman

Problem:
    "Did you know that the following is not valid ML?

	datatype type1 = T of type2 * type3
	withtype type2 = int (* this could be a large expression *)
	and      type3 = type2 * string;

    The reason is that the "datatype datbind withtype typbind" construct is
    expanded out into "datatype datbind'; type typbind" where "datbind'" is
    the the result of using "typbind" to expand "datbind". Note that this
    construct does *not* expand "typbind" itself, so "type2" is out of scope
    in its occurrence in "type3". This simultaneous definition property of
    "withtype" is quite annoying, especially as there is no way to get the
    effect of sequential definition (other than manually expanding out the
    body of "type3" - but that is precisely the problem that "withtype" is
    supposed to solve)."

81. repeated specs in signatures
Submitter: John Reppy
Date: 2/12/89
Version: 0.24
Problem:
    I noticed that a signature of the form

	    sig
		    val x : int
		    val x : string
	    end

    is acceptable.  Although this is in keeping with redeclaration in other
    scopes, it isn't very useful, and lets detectable errors get by.  I would
    suggest that redeclaration of identifiers in signatures ought to at least
    generate a warning message (if not an error).

86. incorrectly allows redefining of "="
Submitter: Dave Berry

Comment:
    The = symbol may not be redefined (Definition, page 4).  The top definition
    does seem to redefine =, despite the lack of response from the system.
    I can't see anything in the Definition that forbids making = nonfix,
    so I suppose it should be possible to use it in a nonfix way.

Comments:
   end_of_stream also blocks, and interrupting a call of end_of_stream
   seems to have the same effect.

   jhr:  This isn't a bug, but rather a "feature."  The sub-process inherits
    the control terminal (/dev/tty) from its parent.  This means that the
    SIGINT generated by ^C is passed to both processes.  I assume that
    there is a work-around, but the semantics are correct for Unix.

92. uncaught Nth exception after type constructor arity mismatch in sigmatch
Submitter: David Tarditi, Princeton University, drt@notecnirp.princeton.edu
Date: 6/23/89
Version: 0.33
System: Vax/4.3 BSD
Problem: Mismatching arities on types causes uncaught exception Nth
	 later in signature checking.

Example:

functor OrdSet(B : sig
			type elem
			val gt : elem * elem -> bool
			val eq : elem * elem -> bool
		   end) =
struct
end

structure Bad =
    struct
	type 'a elem = int * 'a
	val gt = fn ((a:int,_),(b,_)) => a > b
	val eq = fn ((a:int,_),(b,_)) => a = b
    end

structure  X = OrdSet(Bad)

Result:

Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 0.33, 1 April 1989
val it = () : unit
std_in, line 18: Error: mismatching tycon arities: elem
uncaught exception Nth

Comments:

The uncaught exception Nth appears to occur while matching the actual types
of eq and gt against the types in the signature of the formal
structure parameter.

93. type propagation failure with functor application
Submitter: David Tarditi, Princeton University, drt@notecnirp
Date: 7/25/89
Version: 0.33
System: Vax/4.3 BSD
Problem:  Type in a structure passed to a functor remains an opaque
	  type outside the functor.

Example code:

signature T =
sig type 'pos token
end

signature L =
sig structure T : T
end

functor P(structure L : L) =
struct
	open L
end

structure L =
   struct
	structure T = struct
			type 'a token = int * 'a * 'a
		      end
   end

structure B = P(structure L = L)

val x = (5,"","")
val _ = x : string L.T.token  (* this works *)
val _ = x : string B.T.token  (* this causes a type error - why ? *)

Comments:

I thought that the type token should be an abstract (opaque) type only
inside the functor P.  It should be non-opaque in the structure created by
applying the functor P.

Submitter: David Tarditi, Princeton University, drt@notecnirp
Date: 7/25/89

Problem:  The compiler failed by raising a Bind exception
	  which was not caught.

	datatype lcore = LCORE of int
    end

functor mkTable () =
   struct
	structure Dummy = mkDummy()
	structure Lalr = mkLalr()
	val x = fn (Lalr.LCORE l) => l
    end

Comment:
It seems that the compiler fails while compiling an access to a data
constructor inside a functor.  The data constructor must have the
special characteristic that it is created by applying another functor
inside the functor being compiled:

95. infix declaration interferes with type parsing
Submitter: David Tarditi, Princeton University, drt@notecnirp
Date: 4/30/89
Version: 0.33
System: Vax/4.3 BSD
Problem: Spurious declaration of infix for an identifier causes problems
	 when it is used as a type constructor later.

Sample Run:

    Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 0.33, 1 April 1989
    val it = () : unit
    - type ('a,'b) --> = 'a -> 'b;
    type ('a,'b)  --> = 'a -> 'b

    - val a = fn _ => 5;
    val a = fn : 'a -> int

    - a : ('a,int) -->;
    val it = fn : 'a -> int

    - infix -->;

    - a : ('a,int) -->;
    Error: (user) bound type variable propagated out of scope
      it : 'aU -> int

Comments:
	The declaration of an identifier to be infix should not
affect type constructors.  Infix declarations apply only to data
constructors and value identifiers.  The declaration of '-->' to
be infix should not affect the use of '-->' as a type constructor,
even though the declaration is spurious.

P.S.
	Maybe there should be a way to declare type identifiers to be
infix.  I was trying to declare '-->' to be infix because I was creating
different kinds of arrows for my effects inference.  --> could denote
a function that is pure, while -*-> could denote a function with an
effect.  I need to do this to bootstrap the pervasive environment
without assuming that all built-in functions have side-effects.

97. Type checking
Submitter: Mads Tofte
Date: 6/30/89
Version: 0.33
Description:
Here is a program which, although type correct, does not type check
on the NJ compiler --- one gets a type error in the last line.  
It does type check on Poly ML. 
The problem disappears is one erases the explicit result signature
on SymTblFct and it seems that the problem is that sharing is
not propagated correctly in functor application when the signature
has an explicit result signature.
When the internal type stamps are printed, one sees that
the types of the second and the third arguments are ``abstract''
and not instantiated to the stamps for string and real, respectively.

Code: 
signature IntMapSig=
sig
  type 'a map
  exception NotFound
  val apply: 'a map * int -> 'a
  val update: 'a map * int * 'a -> 'a map
  val emptyMap: 'a map
end;

signature ValSig =
sig
  type value
end;

signature SymSig=
sig
  eqtype sym
  val hash: sym -> int
end;


functor SymTblFct(
  structure IntMap: IntMapSig
  structure Val: ValSig
  structure Sym: SymSig):

    sig
      type table
      exception Lookup
      val emptyTable: table
      val update: table * Sym.sym * Val.value -> table
    end=

struct
  datatype table = TBL of
   (Sym.sym * Val.value)list IntMap.map
  val emptyTable = TBL IntMap.emptyMap;

  exception Lookup
  
  fun update(TBL map,s,v)=
   let val n = Sym.hash(s)
       val l = IntMap.apply(map,n) handle IntMap.NotFound => []
       val newmap= IntMap.update(map,n,(s,v)::l)
    in TBL newmap
   end 

end;

functor FastIntMap(): IntMapSig=
struct  (* dummy implementation of int maps *)
  datatype 'a map = N of int * 'a * 'a map * 'a map  
                  | EMPTY
  val emptyMap = EMPTY
  exception NotFound
  fun apply _ = raise NotFound;
  fun update _ = raise NotFound;
end;

functor ValFct(): ValSig=
struct 
  type value = real
end;

functor SymFct(): SymSig=
struct
  type sym = string
  fun hash(s:sym)= ord s
end;

structure MyTbl=
SymTblFct(structure IntMap = FastIntMap()
          structure Val = ValFct()
          structure Sym = SymFct()
         );
              
open MyTbl;
  
update(emptyTable,"ape",10.0);

Comment: parameters Val and Sym appear in result signature of SymTblFct.
This has not been supported previously.

Comment:
Furthermore, a failing program elaboration or evaluation (such as the above)
should not rebind the variable "it" (ML Standard v3, rules 194 and 195).
NJML sometimes does (as above).

Furthermore, trying to print "it" when it has been bound to such an
exception sometimes seems to crash the system (it refuses to respond to
further input); at other times the exception Runbind is raised.

Does anyone know why the largest integer NJML will parse is 1073741775 ?
This is 2^30 - 49, which seems a funny number to choose. (Mike Crawley
suggests the fact that 49 is the ASCII code for "1" may be significant.)

Comment: the compiler should accept both the above definitions,
         which are valid, since the imperative type variable '_a
         is *not* free in the top level declaration.
Comment: (dbm)  Consider the following, which leads to insecurity:
     local exception X of '_a in val exn0 = X(3) fun h(X(b:bool)) = b end;
     raise exn0 handle e => h(e);

Comment: NJML accepts this signature but shouldn't. Getting the
         equality attribute right in the presence of sharing

But the scope of ''a and 'b is the whole of the fun declaration.  The problem
seems to be associated with mutual recursion.

  type (''a, 'b)map = (''a *  'b) list

  fun plus(l:(''a,'b)map ,[]: (''a, 'b)map ): (''a, 'b)map = l

Version: 0.33
Problem: 
New Jersey ML does not accept the following functor declaration (it
complains that S.x is not of equality type).  According to the
Definition, two types share only if they have the same name (stamp).
In particular, since equality is an attribute of type names (Version
3, page 16), one admits equality iff the other does (one cannot have
different ``views'' of equality).  

Presumably the problem is a bug in the unification of type names.

Code:
    functor f(structure S : sig type t val x: t end
	      structure T : sig eqtype t end
	      sharing S = T

135. eqtype vs abstype
Submitted: Bernard Sufrin (sufrin%prg.oxford.ac.uk@NSFnet-Relay.AC.UK)
Date: 7/26/89
Version: 0.33
Problem: interaction of abstype and eqtype

I ran into this problem whilst writing you a long note concerning
abstraction bindings structure bindings and their respect for type and
eqtype specifications. Here's a miniature version of the larger
problem.

We want a pair of types Open and Shut, and transfer functions between
them. The two signatures below are candidates for describing such a
structure: the latter leaves visible the equality on Open, the former
should not.

    signature T =
    sig
      type Shut
      type Open
      val Shut:Open->Shut
      and Open: Shut->Open
    end

    signature U =
    sig
      type Shut
      eqtype Open
      val Shut:Open->Shut
      and Open: Shut->Open
    end

Now we design a functor which simply wraps something up in order to shut it.

    functor absT(type Open)  =
    struct
      type Open = Open
      abstype Shut = SHUT of Open  with
	val Shut  = SHUT
	fun Open(SHUT x) = x
      end
    end

Now we instantiate it:

    structure b:T = absT(type Open=int)

Compiler yields:

    structure b :
    sig
      eqtype Shut         <----- can't be right, surely
      eqtype Open
      val Open : Shut -> Open
      val Shut : Open -> Shut
    end

The equality on Shut has leaked, despite the fact that the actual
representation of Shut is an abstype. (The same happens if absT is
itself constrained to yield a T)

    - b.Shut 3=b.Shut 4;
    val it = false : bool

On the other hand using an abstraction binding

    abstraction ab:T = absT(type Open=int)

Compiler yields, correctly,

    structure ab :
      sig
	type Shut
	type Open
	val Open : Shut -> Open
	val Shut : Open -> Shut
      end

but I cannot actually apply ab.Shut to an integer (its domain is not
int, but an opaque and different type, namely ab.Open).  Now let's try

    abstraction au:U = absT(type Open=int)

Compiler yields, correctly,

    structure au :
    sig
      type Shut                                    
      eqtype Open
      val Open : Shut -> Open
      val Shut : Open -> Shut
    end

but I still can't apply au.Shut to an integer. Incidentally in my
original note I asked (a) whether I ought to be able to, (b) if so,
whether eqtype was not getting a bit overloaded [equality visible AND
representation visible] (c) if not, how could one do this sort of
thing at all?

Meanwhile

    structure argh:U = absT(type Open=int)

still makes Open and Shut both eqtypes.  More bizarrely, we have

    abstype opaque = opaque of int with
     val hide = opaque
     val show = fn(opaque x)=>x
    end

    structure biz:T = absT(type Open=opaque)

Compiler yields

    structure biz :
      sig
	eqtype Shut                 <--- wow!
	type Open
	val Open : Shut -> Open
	val Shut : Open -> Shut
      end

Shut is now an eqtype despite being an abstype whose representation
includes another abstype!

139.  compiling with gcc doesn't work 
Submitter: Brian Boutel, brian@comp.vuw.ac.nz
Date: 9 November 1989
Version: 0.36 & later
System: HP/Sun 3
Problem: compiling with gcc doesn't work 
Description:

    I have been trying again to port sml to H-P 68030 boxes running
    MORE/bsd, using the Gnu C  compiler. 

    We have a mix of Sun3 and H-P machines, and, although I have installed
    sml on the suns, it would be convenient to have it available on the H-Ps as well.

    The H-P port has not worked, and to separate the problems arising from
    the Operating System from those arising from the use of gcc, I have
    tried building sml on the suns with gcc (using the -traditional
    option). The build completes, but the resulting sml dies immediately
    while doing a major garbage collection. It does not get as far as
    announcing itself as Standard ML of .....
    I have tried various options, (optimiser on/off some of the gcc -f
    options) without effect. Have you tried gcc? I am anxious to persue
    this as  I think getting a gcc compiled version to run on the suns is
    the right first step towards porting to the H-Ps. Can you offer any suggestions?

    I am using sml version 0.36.  ( I tried today to ftp to
    research.att.com to check for a later version, but found an empty
    directory when logging on as anonymous, and was refused permission to
    log on as mldist.)


    Changes made to the source are summarised as

    ------
    gnu C compiler requires f68881 to be changed to m68881
    Changed in makeml by introducing $CCOMP, set to GNUCC for machine hp300,
    otherwise "", and testing it in defining CFL for M68

    ----------------
    for H-P, sys/exec.h defines MID_HP300 instead of M_68020
    linkdata.c and export.c have conditional code if HP300 defined
    makeml has to pass HP300 to make for linkdata
    -------------
    for H-P, callgc.c has FPE_TRAPV_TRAP undefined, and
    TRAPV returns FPE_INTOVF_TRAP
    so FPE_TRAPV_TRAP is defined as FPE_INTOVF_TRAP in callgc.c
    ----------
    _minitfp_ and _fp_state_mc68881 not defined anywhere for H-P
    .globl omitted if HP300 in M68.prim.s
    --------------------
    run dies because stack clobbered by apply
    Registers saved ala NeXT/MACH in saveregs/restoreregs in prim.s if GNUCC

141. interrupting gc dumps core
Submitter: peter@central.cis.upenn.edu (Peter Buneman)
Date: 18 November 1989
Version: 0.39
System: ??
Problem:
    I've found occasions on which our current version of ML goes a bit
    flakey after being interrupted during garbage collection.  I haven't
    been able to pin it down until now.  The following interactive session
    appears to be repeatable.
Code:
    % sml
    Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 0.39, 8 September 1989
    val it = () : unit
    - fun foo() = 1::foo();
    val foo = fn : unit -> int list
    - foo();

    [Major collection...
    [Increasing heap to 7144k]
     70% used (1752720/2487664), 4810 msec]

    [Major collection... 62% used (2484132/3975316), 7580 msec]
		  *** I typed <cntrl>C during this garbage collection
    [Increasing heap to 11648k]

    - fun bar() = bar();
    val bar = fn : unit -> 'a
    - bar();      *** I did not type <cntrl>C here !!
    uncaught exception Interrupt
    - bar();      *** nor here!!
    uncaught exception Interrupt

Comments:
    In 0.43d2 I can't repeat this behavior, but interrupting during gc causes
    a bus error or segmentation fault. [dbm]

142. import incompatible with interpreter only image
Submitter: Bernard Sufrin <sufrin%prg.oxford.ac.uk@NSFnet-Relay.AC.UK>
Date: 27 Sept 1989
Version: 0.39
System: Sun 3 ?
Problem: import into interpreter
Description:
    OK; when making the intepreter-only it seems one must:

	    makeml -noshare -noclean -run
	    makeml -ionly -noshare -norun 

    Then one gets the smaller (by about 200k) file. 

    Problem: it is not possible to import precompiled stuff; the compiler 
    decides that the .bin file is not in the right format; tries to recompile,
    and fails for lack of a code generator.

    Here's an example...

    - import "/prg/pl/sml/lib/lex";
    [reading /prg/pl/sml/lib/lex.bin... ]
    [/prg/pl/sml/lib/lex.bin is the wrong format; recompiling]
    [closing /prg/pl/sml/lib/lex.bin]
    [reading /prg/pl/sml/lib/lex.sml]
      [reading /prg/pl/sml/lib/lib/lib/extend.bin... ]
      [/prg/pl/sml/lib/lib/lib/extend.bin is the wrong format; recompiling]
      [closing /prg/pl/sml/lib/lib/lib/extend.bin]
      [reading /prg/pl/sml/lib/lib/lib/extend.sml]
    /prg/pl/sml/lib/lib/lib/extend.sml, line 52: Error: Compiler bug: no code generator!
      [closing /prg/pl/sml/lib/lib/lib/extend.sml]
    [closing /prg/pl/sml/lib/lex.sml]
    IMPORT failed (compile-time exception: Syntax)

    When trying to reproduce the import bug
    you might try making the dependency graph more than three arcs deep.

Comments:
    Obviously we don't want to have to dispense with import
    when using the intepreter-only (typically it'd be students loading
    precompiled libraries), but I presume we don't want the complication of
    lambda-formatted bin files as well as machine code bin files.  May I
    propose the following:

    import from an ionly system should behave like import in the cg system if
    everything is up-to-date.

    if something is out of date, then import should either abort, or behave
    like use (I prefer the latter, I think, but you might make it
    controllable from a System.Control variable).

143. use failes on certain input files of a certain length
Submitter: Jawahar Malhotra (malhotra%metasoft.uucp@BBN.COM)
Date: 26 October 1989
Version: ??
System: ??
Problem: use dumping core on magic input file length
Description:
    I have a source file which contains a signature definition and a
    functor definition. When I load it using the "use" statement, the
    compiler responds with the signature defn and the functor defn but
    then dumps core just before its prints the [<closing file>] line.
    Strangely, if I add another blank line to the file, everything is 
    OK. If you like, I can mail you the file; please let me know if
    you would like the file.

    Here is a reproduction of the compiler's output:

    - use "oareadattr.sml";
    [opening oareadattr.sml]
    signature OAREADATTR = ...
    ...
    ...
      end
    functor OAReadAttrFun : <sig>

144. not waiting for child process
Submitter: Jawahar Malhotra, Meta Software; malhotra%metasoft@bbn.com
Date: 20 Oct 89
Version: 0.33
System: SUN OS 3.5
Problem: 	
	njsml doesn't wait for child process (created by a call to
	execute) to terminate. Suppose I execute the following 
	sml stmt:

	- execute "ls /users/malhotra";

	njsml creates a child process in which it runs ls. When ls 
	is done, it does an exit(0). In order for the exit to
	complete, its parent process (njsml in this case) should
	do a wait(). However, njsml doesn't do this and hence the
	"ls" process blocks on its exit and remains until njsml
	exits. The state of this process (as displayed by "ps") is:

	malhotra  2376  0.0  0.1    0    0 p2 Z     0:00 <exiting>

Comments: 
	One fix would be to prevent the process created by "execute" from
	being njsml's child. In this case, njsml would not have to wait to
	collect the child's termination status. This can be done by
	forking twice. Hence the code for execute might look like:
	(assume njsml is process p1)

	------------------------------------------------------------

	/* in process p1 */

	if (fork() == 0)	{	/* in p2 */
		if (fork() == 0) {	/* in p3 */
			.........			
			execl(......);
			.......
		}
		else {				/* in p2 */
			exit(0);
		}
	}
	
	/* in p1 */

	wait(0);			/* wait for p2 to exit */

	------------------------------------------------------------	

	Another fix (maybe easier to implement) is to install a signal
	handler for SIGCHLD.

	signal(SIGCHLD, ack);

	where ack() is simply:

	ack()
	{
	  wait(0);
	}

145. stale top-level continuations cause type bugs
Submitter: Andrzej Filinski, CMU Computer Science (andrzej@cs.cmu.edu)
Date: Oct 11, 1989
Version: 0.39 (8 September 1989)
System: Sun3/4.3BSD
Problem: Capturing top-level continuation messes up the type system
Code:

    val cl = ref([]:int cont list);
    callcc (fn k=>(cl:=[k]; 42));
    val u = throw (hd (!cl)) 65; (* value 65 with universal type! *)
    u+1;     (* u as integer *)
    u^"str"; (* u as string *)
    u:bool;  (* u as boolean (cannot print) *)
    u:real;  (* u as real (core dump) *)

Comments: This may be a tricky problem, i.e. it is not quite clear
what the "right" behavior should be when the top-level continuation
is captured and carried across commands. Please don't take this as a
criticism of callcc/throw in general, though; they're great! Any plans
for integrating them more deeply in the language, like exceptions?

Problem: compiler out to lunch
Description:
    I have a large-ish list of type:
	    (string * string list) list

    It has 1003 entries, and on average the string list in each pair is around
    3 elements.  Each string is between 5 and 9 characters.

    The list is declared in a file in the form:
	    val graph = [ ("foo", ["bar"]), ... etc ...];
    This is the only declaration in the file. Poly-ml compiles the file
    in about 10 seconds.

    Njml takes around an hour to increase the heap to 30Mbytes, performs several
    major collects, and then bombs with an out-of-memory error.

150. incomplete sharing spec accepted
Submitter:  Simon Finn <simon%abstract-hardware-ltd.co.uk@NSFnet-Relay.AC.UK>
Date: 13 Sept 89
Version: 0.33
Problem:

    signature SIG =
    sig
      type t
      sharing type t

Comments:
    The above signature is illegal, since sharing constraints must involve

157. nested imports corrupt memory (same as 154?)
Submitter: sufrin%prg.oxford.ac.uk@NSFnet-Relay.AC.UK
Date: 3 Nov 89
Version: 0.39
System: Sun 3
Problem:
    I have had a good deal of trouble with transitive imports. Symptom is
    segmentation failure on first call of a procedure defined in a functor
    imported transitively.

    parser:
	    defines abstractsyntax, lexer, and parser functors

    codegen:
	    imports parser
	    defines code generator 

    main:
	    imports codegen
	    instantiates abstractsyntax, lexer, parser
	    crashes at first invocation of procedure defined in parser.

    When I remove the "import parser" from codegen, and 
    import it directly from main, then all is well.

    This actually arose in a student's system, and I haven't time to try it in
    smaller contexts.  Does the symptom sound familiar? If not, I can send the
    whole lot to you.

159. nested structure reference causes compiler bug
Submitter: Tom Murtagh, Rice University, tpm@rice.edu

System: Sun4/SunOS 4.0.3c and Sun3/SunOS 4.0.?
Problem: Compiler dies on reference to type from a nested structure
Description:
    I ran into another problem with the compiler.  This one does not
    appear to have anything to do with the port to SPARC.  I ran it
    on a Sparcstation using verion 0.38 and on a Sun3 running version
    0.39 (Bruce's copy) and it died on both.  It compiled without
    complaint on a Sun 3 running verions 0.33 (which is installed
    in the public local software directory here).

Code: (smaller.sml = /usr/sml/bugs/code/bug.159)
    signature SYMTAB =
	sig
	    type ident
	end

    signature LEX =
	sig
	    structure Symtab : SYMTAB

	    datatype lexeme =
		ID of Symtab.ident
	      | DELIM
	end

    structure Symtab =
	struct
	    type ident = string
	end

    functor lex( symtab : SYMTAB ) =
	struct
	    structure Symtab : SYMTAB = symtab
	    datatype lexeme =
		ID of Symtab.ident
	      | DELIM
	end

Comment:
    Almost any perturbation of the above seems to make the bug disappear, e.g.
    (1) removing "structure Struct1 : SIG1"
    (2) or removing "type s" from SIG1
    (3) or taking "f" out of "Sub" and putting it at the top level of "Struct2" 
  [dbm] behavior is different under 43d2.  It produces a lookTycPath subscript

Comments:	I changed yesterday (Dec 3) from 0.42 to 0.43, and I have 
		been trying all day (Dec 4) to solve my problem, until I
		made the little test above. During the solving periode I also
		had a lot of:

		    ../file, line xxx: Error: structure sharing violation

		In that periode I was using "import", not "use". These 
		error messages may show up to be caused by the same bug.

Fix: 		Sorry, I'm not able to fix it. But I hope my example have 
		given you enough input to track down the bug.

175. redundant module loading

depend on files which have been, or need to be, recompiled?

Problem:
    ... the diagnostic messages for sharing mismatches are not really
    useable: having a single message "structure sharing violation" for 100
    lines of nested functor applications is no use, and I often have to
    recompile the entire system in Poly/ML just to get more verbose
    diagnostics with the context of the offending functor application and
    the names of the offending structures/types.

181. 8-bit characters not supported in strings

Version: 0.44
Problem:
    I am looking to read in 8 bit characters in SML-NJ.  I can get UNIX
    to pass 8 bits back & forth, and SML-NJ will PRINT strings containing
    escaped "8-bit characters" (i.e., \nnn) as honest 8-bit output, but for
    the life of me I cannot get it to READ 8-bit characters when i put them in
    a string (I get an "Ord exception").  Is this intended behavior?
    Is there any workaround (say, a switch I didn't notice?)?

185. exportML size

           Denmark
           schristensen@daimi.dk
Date:      24 jan 90
Version:   0.44
System:    Sun4/280 / SunOS 4.0.1
Severity:  ???
Problem:
Ussualy I have build my application by declaring a number of structures,
this could be done using less than 45Mb of heapspace, even if I set the
the flags like:

 System.Control.CG.reducemore := 0;
 System.Control.CG.rounds := 10;
 System.Control.CG.bodysize := 20;

The system produced from an "exportML" of this takes up app. 3Mb.

>From "doc/optimize" I learned that the code could be optimized by
enclosing it in one structure. I did like:

structure whole :
  sig
   < ... >
  end =
struct
 <The usual stuff ..>
end;
open whole;

It meant that the heapsize had to be increased to 80 Mb and I had to reset
the above flags.

I observed a bug in the reporting of GC:
...
[Major collection... 76% used (18670576/24426980), 34260 msec]

[Increasing heap to 59632k]

[Major collection... -57% used (25033788/31118476), 44190 msec]

[Increasing heap to 68216k]

[Major collection... -35% used (30575468/34993364), 54880 msec]
...

The "-57%" should be "80%" and the "-35%" should be "87%".

But the main problem  is that the CG before the "exportML" only decreases
the heap to 49Mb, and then it stops with the message "export" - due to no
disk space (?)

Comments: (appel)  Setting these flags for optimization may cause the
code generator to generate very large output.  Use at your own risk.

187. parsing clausal definitions with infix functions
Submitter: Mick Francis
Date: 1/11/90
Version: 0.44(?)
Problem:
    1) Infix function declarations using parentheses do not parse. E.g.
	    infix xxx;
	    fun (a xxx b)   = b; (* Will not compile *)
	    fun (a xxx b) c = c; (* Will not compile *)

    2) When an infix identifier appears as the first of more than 2 formal
       parameters in a function declaration, if the second formal parameter
       is an identifier, an attempt is made to declare a function with this
       name. E.g.
	    infix xxx;
	    fun a xxx b c = c;   (* Compiles function b ??? *)
	    fun a xxx nil c = c; (* Tries to bind nil - error *)

    Incidentally, Poly/ML gets the following wrong :-
	infix xxx;
	fun a xxx b d = d;

    It gives the message :-
	Error- Constructor (b) has not been declared   Found near b(y)

    It appears to be looking for a pat, not an atpat on either side of the xxx.

193. import types
Submitter: Nick Rothwell
Date: 1/5/90
Version: 0.44a (0.44 with import fix)
Problem:
   I've enclosed a bug in NJ SML 0.44a, based on a bug report I received
from people at HP. I've managed to narrow it down to a simple example.
It seems to be a strange interaction between the type import code of the
separate compilation mechanism, the functor typechecking, and the checking
of record types (of all things!). Unfortunately, I don't know anything about
how types are imported under separate compilation, so I can't take it much
further.
Transcript:
I enclose two files, A.sml and B.sml. B.sml is a simple script that imports
A. Try the following: use "B.sml" (so that A gets imported and compiled), and
then >exit the system<. Start another session and use "B.sml" again. You
should get the following error:

        B.sml, line 8: Error: operator and operand don't agree (tycon mismatch)
          operator domain: {X:'S}
          operand:         {X:int}
          in expression:
            FOO {X=3}
Code:
    *** A.sml ***
    signature A =
      sig
	datatype 'a Foo = FOO of {X: 'a}
	    (* Must be a record type to reproduce the bug. *)
      end;

    functor A(): A =        (* Must have sig constraint to reproduce the bug *)
      struct
	datatype 'a Foo = FOO of {X: 'a}
      end;

    *** B.sml ***
    import "A";

    structure ??? = A();    (*Needed to reproduce the bug*)

    functor F(structure A: A) =
      struct
	val _ = A.FOO{X=3}
      end;

194. weak type variable syntax

Version: 0.44?
Problem: 
    There seems to be one slight problem in the documentation on support
    for imperative type variables as described in the Standard.  I took
    the documentation to mean that '_a is an abbreviation for '1a.  This
    isn't true.  If you try the code at the bottom, you'll see this.
Code:
    (* Sample code:  The second declaration of y causes a type error *)
    val x = fn (a,b) => (ref a; ref (a b));
    val y = x : ('1a -> '1b) * '1a -> '1b ref;

Version:        0.43
System:         Sun 3/60 -- SunOs 4.0.3
Severity:       Depends on the the importness of the the noshare
                version of the compiler and exportFn

Problem:        I make standalone versions of the lex and yacc,
                included in the distribution. I use the following
                code, to make a standalone version of "smlyacc", and
                similar for my "smllex" (feeding it to the noshare
                version of sml):

                | use "load.sml";
                | loadAll();
                | open ParseGen;
                |
                | fun main (argv, env) =
                |     let
                |         val argc = length argv
                |         val prog = hd argv
                |     in
                |         (if (argc <> 2) then
                |             outputc std_out ("Usage: " ^ prog ^ " file\n")
                |          else
                |              let
                |                  val file = hd (tl argv)
                |              in
                |                   parseGen file
                |                   handle Io s =>
                |                       outputc std_out
                |                           (prog ^ ": Couldn't open file: "
                |                            ^ file ^ "\n")
                |              end;
                |              outputc std_out "\n")
                |     end;
                |
                | exportFn ("smlyacc", main);

                The problem then is this: When making "smllex"
                everything works fine, and I get (on Sun 3/60) a
                standalone version of 208K. But the "smlyacc" version,
                though it compiles fine and runs, on more than 2000K.

                I used the same procedure with version 0.39, and the
                standalone version of "smlyacc" then was 368K.

                It seems to me that when exporting "smlyacc", the
                runtime system isn't thrown away, as when "smllex"
                was generated.

202. type error not caught?
Submitter: Norman Ramsey
Date: 8/28/89
Version: ?
Problem:
    I believe that the following file should generate a type error, but
    it doesn't.  In particular, the line val _ = begin_str "replicas"
    ufanout(c,chans) should force chans to be type 'a chan list when c is
    type 'a chan.
Code:
    datatype 'a chan = CHAN of 'a

    signature BADGUYS = sig
	val mkchan : unit -> '1a chan
	val ufanout : '2a chan * '2a chan list -> 'b
	val begin_str :  string -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> unit
    end

    signature WONKY =  sig
	val ureplicas : int -> '2a chan -> '6b chan list
		    (* wrong! should be int -> '2a chan -> '2a chan list *)
      end

    functor buggy(bad:BADGUYS):WONKY = struct

    open bad

    fun ureplicas n c =     (* n unsynchronized copies of channel c *)
	let fun channels(l,0) = l

209. equality types and functors, again
Submitter: Appel & MacQueen
Date: 4/30/90
Version: 0.56
Problem:
    Problem in eqtypes/defineEqTycon/eqty.  failure when attempting to
    reevaluate equality properties of generative/defined tycons in functor body
    after functor is applied.
Code: 
    signature S1 = sig type t end;
    structure A = struct type t = int end;
    functor F(X : S1)  =  
    struct
      structure B = struct datatype s1 = K of X.t end
      type s = B.s1
    end;
    structure C = F(A);
Comments:  we've put in a warning message, and assumed a non-equality type
	when this happens.  (still causes impossible error in 0.56).
Status:	This appears to be fixed in 0.57.  DEFtycs can no longer cause this
	particular problem because they do not have an eqprop field that needs
	to be recalculated on functor application.  May be other forms of this
	problem still lurking, however.

210. sharing checking with fixed stamps
Submitter: Appel & MacQueen
Date: 5/3/90
Version: 0.56
Problem:
    Union exception is not caught when sharing specs try to identify two distinct
    types or structures (with differing fixed stamps).
Code:
    structure S = struct end;
    structure T = struct end;
    signature Q = sig sharing S=T end;
Comments:
    Easy to fix.  Just add a handler for the Union exception in Sharing.doSharing
    and produce and appropriate error message.

211. Union exception processing correct sharing in functor body
Submitter: MacQueen
Date: 5/4/90
Version: 0.56
Problem:
    Union exception is raised in doSharing when processing correct sharing
    specs in a functor body.
Code: (* bug211.sml *)
    functor F(type t) =
    struct
      structure K =
      struct 
	type s = t
      end
      structure M : sig structure L : sig type s sharing type s = t end
			sharing L=K
		    end =
      struct
	structure L = K
      end
    end;

Comments:
    The bug occurs because the type definition shortcut (for "type s = t", s
    is made a copy (modulo path) of t) is not done when t has a bound stamp,
    as in the code above.  Here s is a DEFtyc tycon with a different stamp
    from t.

Comments:

These problems don't occur on the m68 version of SML. In fact,
the problem with "sin" that I reported previously also doesn't
occur with the m68 version.

Maybe this is an installation problem, but if it is, then there is
probably something wrong with the makeml script. The Sparc version
was generated with "makeml -sun4 -sunos" if I remember correctly.

Problem:

Fix:
Some of the problems may be caused by handleprof() in runtime/signal.c
being braindamaged.  I changed it to be:

  SIGH_RET_TYPE handleprof ()
  {
    extern ML_val_t current0[];
    ML_val_t cur_barray = current0[1];
    cur_barray[1] = (unsigned int)INT_incr(cur_barray[1],1);
  }

and it seemed to work for simple examples.  However, I'm not too sure
that the times mean anything for larger examples.  Perhaps there's some
bad interaction with GC?

223. nontty standard input and uncaught exceptions
Submitter:	KINOSHITA Yoshiki	yoshiki@etl.go.jp
Date:		4, June 1990
Version:	SML of NJ 0.56
System:		Sparc Station 330 (SUN4), SUN-OS 4.0.3 (generic version)
Severity:	major
Problem:	If the standard input is a pipe, the system ends
		abnormally after it sends an error message.

Comments:	This problem makes it impossible to use the system with
		its input sent through a UNIX filter.
  from jhr:
    You might call this a feature.  It appears that the person who wrote
    the top-level loop code (interact.sml), decided that exceptions
    should only be caught at the top-level loop when std_in is a tty
    (look at lines 292-309 in interact.sml).  The following work-around
    avoids the problem

      - 1+2;
      val it = 3 : int
      - 

    But, maybe the code should change.  It isn't clear to me what the correct
    semantics are in this case.  This problem came up here at Cornell when
    Bill Aitken was using "rsh" to run sml on a remote machine.

235. repeated type variables in typdesc and datdesc
Submitter:      Don Sannella <dts@informatik.uni-Bremen.de>
Date:		6/13/90
Version:        0.44?
Severity:       major
Problem:
    The Definition of SML seems to allow repeated type variables in a typdesc and
    datdesc, making the following signatures legal:

    signature SIG1 =
	 sig
	    eqtype ('a,'a) t1
	    type ('a,'a) t2
	 end

    signature SIG2 =
	 sig
	    datatype ('a,'a) t3 = foo of 'a
	 end

    Section 2.9 forbids repeated variables in a typbind and datbind, but I don't
    see anything forbidding it in a typdesc or datdesc.  I assume below that the
    omission of a syntactic restriction here was intentional.

    Repeated type variables in a typdesc seem unproblematic if strange, since the
    semantics only looks at the number of variables.  SML-NJ accepts SIG1 above,
    and treats it the same as a signature without repeated type variables, which is
    correct.

    Repeated type variables in a datdesc are more of a problem, since the
    constructors refer to them.  According to the Definition, foo in SIG2 above
    gets type 'a -> ('a,'a) t3.  Both of the following structures then match SIG2:

    structure A =
	 struct
	    datatype ('a,'b) t3 = foo of 'a
	 end

    structure B =
	 struct
	    datatype ('a,'b) t3 = foo of 'b
	 end

    SML-NJ (version 0.44a) says foo : 'a -> ('a,'b) t3, which is wrong.  The result
    of this is that A matches SIG2 but B does not.  I don't know about Poly-SML,
    since I don't have it here.

Comments:
    I have installed version 0.59 on Vaxes, Suns, and Pmaxes running Mach.

    There were two problems:

    VAX.prim.s contained a reference to the variable maskSignals.
    The name should be _maskSignals instead.

    The file export.c should also include the file ml_os.h, which
    contains some definitions needed for Decstations running Mach.

Submitter:      Allen Leung. allen@sbcs.sunysb.edu
Date:           July 12th, 1990
Version:        v59    4 June, 1990
System:         SUN 3 on bsd
Severity:       minor
Problem:        Toplevel printing of abstype is transparent.
Code:           - abstype Foo = Foo of int
                = with fun foo i = Foo i end
                = val bar = foo 0;
                > type Foo
                > val foo = fn : int -> Foo
                > val bar = Foo 0 : Foo    (* instead of - : Foo *)

241. sharing constraint error ignored
Submitter:      David Turner
Date:           12 July '90
Version:        0.59
System:         Sun4
Severity:       Slightly irritating
Problem:        Ignores error in sharing constraint even though it
		obviously detects it.

Input:
        - signature S = sig  type t  end;

	- functor F
	    (structure A : S
	     structure B : S
	    	sharing type B.t = A.s) = struct end;

Output:
	Error: unbound type in structure: s
	functor F : <sig>
Comment:
  Nonstandard function used in doSharing to report the bug.
  In 0.65 error message is:
     std_in:9.6-11.23 Error: unbound type in structure: s
  This doesn't provide as much useful information as it should.  Error
  message should read something like "unbound type A.s in sharing spec".

246. repeated import consumes too much memory
Submitter:      Peter Canning  <canning@hplabs.hp.com>
Date:		27 June 1990
Version:        0.56
System:         HP900S370 (m68030)  HP-UX 7.0
Severity:       major
Problem:        repeated use of the import facility causes the heap to grow
Code:           <example code that reproduces the problem>
Transcript:     <transcript of session illustrating problem>
Comments:
    In particular, if I repeatedly modify a file, import the file, then run the
    program defined in the file (the standard edit/compile/debug loop), my sml
    image seems to grow (and never shink again).  When I was just using "use",
    sml would garbage collect freqently, but the process size would stay between
    4000 and 5000 Kbytes.  Using import (working on the same program), the
    process has grown as large as 11000 Kbytes.  It appears that for some reason
    some data related to importing/compiling files is not being reclaimed by the
    garbage collector.

248. abstract types are not abstract
Submitter:      Dave MacQueen
Date:		7/16/90
Version:        0.59 (0.57 and later)
Severity:       major
Problem:
   Abstract types defined by abstype declarations are not made abstract
  (i.e. converted from DATAtyc to ABStyc form), and their equality property
  is not reset to NO.  Equality properties of types defined in terms of the
  abstype are not recomputed (see bug 231.)
Comments:
  After the abstype body has been processed, the concrete form of the abstract
  types must be replaced by the abstract form throughout the 'signature' of the
  exported bindings (values, constructors, types).  Also equality properties
  of exported types have to be reevaluated.
  Currently, there is a function that attempts to transform the tycons in the
  type checker, but it affects only the abstract syntax, and not the static
  environment.  The problem results from the removal of the ref around tycons
  in 0.57.
Status: fixed in 0.64.

249. separate compilation printing problems
Submitter:      Nick Rothwell <nick@lfcs.ed.ac.uk> (also Richard O'Neill)
Date:		7/5/90
Version:        0.59
Severity:       minor
Problem:
    0. If only one or other of the files exists (say, Foo.sml without Foo.bin
	or vice versa), the exception SystemCall gets raised.

    1. The error message

		[Foo.bin is in the wrong format; recompiling]

    seems to have lost its closing "]" in 0.59.

    2. The final bindings from a separately compiled module get
    printed on one line, as in:

    signature Asignature Bsignature Csignature D- 

    rather than

    signature A
    signature B
    etc.
Fix:  (Richard O'Neill)
    For some reason the function printBindingTbl in print/printdec.sml was changed
    from its form in release 0.56 to a slightly modified forn in 0.59. The new
    form is functionally equivalent appart from omiting to generate newlines.

    Fix (currently untried):

    Return printBindingTbl to it 0.56 form.
Status: fixed in 0.64(?)

250. interpreter broken
Submitter:      Richard O'Neill (cmp7130%sys.uea.ac.uk@nsfnet-relay.ac.uk)
Date:		Tue Jul 17 12:24:19 BST 1990
Version:        0.59
System:         Sun3, SunOS 4.1
Severity:       Major
Problem:

In interpret mode, version 0.59 fails with no explanation when compiling a
grammar from mlyacc (slightly modified to use 'import'), whilst in compile
mode, the grammar is compiled correctly. Version 0.56 does not exhibit the same
problem.

This seems a significant problem since using compile mode takes significant
time and memory. Equally, I cannot use version 0.56 due to some of its bugs
which manifest themselves when compiling other modules.

I have not included the files as they are rather long (being an mlyacc 
generated parser and the relevant support files). I can supply you with a
uuencoded compressed tar archive of them all if you desire.

251. omits tests for repeated bindings
Submitter:      Dave Berry db@lfcs.ed.ac.uk

Version:        0.59
System:         All (I presume; actually tested on a Sun 3 with SunOS 4.0)
Severity:       minor
Problem:        omits tests for repeated bindings
Code:           

type t = int and t = string;

exception E and E;

val rec f = fn x => x + 1
and f = fn n => if n > 0 then 1 else n * f (n - 1);

Transcript:

- type t = int and t = string;
type  t = int
type  t = string

- exception E and E;
exception E
exception E

- val rec f = fn x => x + 1
= and f = fn n => if n > 0 then 1 else n * f (n - 1);
val f = fn : int -> int
val f = fn : int -> int

Comments:

I expect that few people would make these mistakes in "real"
code, but they might be more common when teaching.

The tests are made for repeated constructors in a datatype,
and in some (non-recursive?) value bindings, e.g.

- datatype a = A | A;
std_in:3.14-3.18 Error: duplicate constructor name

- val a = 1 and a = 2;
std_in:2.5-2.19 Error: duplicate variable-name `a' in pattern(s)

Page 9 is the relevant part of the definition.

255. space leak with redeclaration of variables
Submitter: John Reppy
Date:	   7/24/90
Version:   0.60
Severity:  major
Problem:
    I think that there is a space leak in the top-level loop/environment.
    If I keep redefining the same identifiers, the amount of live data
    grows, when it should be fairly constant.  I assume that the problem
    is that the top-level symbol table is holding onto something it shouldn't.
Transcript:
Here is a simple demonstration of the space leak (60 bytes/iteration):

  Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 0.60, 13 July 1990
  val it = () : unit
  - structure S = struct val _ = System.Unsafe.CInterface.gc 1 end;

  [Major collection... 98% used (516680/526692), 610 msec]
  structure S :
    sig
    end
  - structure S = struct val _ = System.Unsafe.CInterface.gc 1 end;

  [Major collection... 98% used (517100/525980), 550 msec]
  structure S :
    sig
    end
  - structure S = struct val _ = System.Unsafe.CInterface.gc 1 end;

  [Major collection... 98% used (517160/526388), 550 msec]
  structure S :
    sig
    end
  - structure S = struct val _ = System.Unsafe.CInterface.gc 1 end;

  [Major collection... 98% used (517220/526448), 550 msec]
  structure S :
    sig
    end
  - structure S = struct val _ = System.Unsafe.CInterface.gc 1 end;

  [Major collection... 98% used (517280/526508), 540 msec]
  structure S :
    sig
    end

Comment: (appel) This is the top-level line-number information, and
	 is a few bytes per line, regardless of size of defined structures.
Status: fixed in 0.65 (actually, it's now a 48-byte leak)

256. mcopt compiler bug with improper function definition
Submitter: John Mitchell (jcm@iswim.stanford.edu)
Date:      7/24/90
Version:   0.60
Severity:  critical
Problem:
    Compiler bug "r_o in mcopt" raised as a result of improper clausal
    function definition.

259. uncaught exception Match compiling normperv.sml
Submitter:      Richard O'Neill (cmp7130%sys.uea.ac.uk@nsfnet-relay.ac.uk)
Date:		Tue Aug 14 10:04:21 BST 1990
Version:        0.63 (not in 0.62 or earlier)
System:         Sun3/180, SunOS 4.1
Severity:       Critical
Problem:

Version 0.63 has a new bug whereby it cannot compile dbguser/normperv.sml
This prevents creating the '-debug' version.

uncaught exception Match

Comments:

Smlc, version 0.62, created the 680X0 '.mo' files from which a -pervshare
runtime system was built using gcc. This runtime system was then used to build
a normal and then a -debug system (which failed).

I've marked the severity as critical because it is a critical problem for this
version. For me however, its not so critical as I seem to be managing OK with
0.62.

260. failure to raise overflow
Submitter: David.Tarditi@B.GP.CS.CMU.EDU
Date: Mon, 13 Aug 90 15:43:26 EDT
Version: 0.63?
Problem:
The following program should raise an Overflow exception on all
32-bit 2's complement machines but it doesn't:
-------
fun exp 0 = 1 | exp i = 2 * exp (i-1);

val a = exp 29;
val minint = ~a + ~a;

(* should raise overflow *)

val test = minint div ~1;
-------
An overflow exception was not raised in version 0.59 on a Sun 3 running
Mach emluating 4.3 BSD.  It was raised in version 0.59 on a MicroVax 3
running Mach emulating 4.3 BSD.

Comments:

This is the only case where overflow can occur in division.  It occurs
since MININT = -(MAXINT+1) in 2's complement.  Division of MININT by -1 
causes an overflow.

261. Compiler Bug: abstractBody.abstractType 1 (assumed same as 234)
Submitter:	George Beshers, beshers@sun2.brc.uconn.edu
Date:		Aug 9, 1990
Version:	0.56, sparc
Severity:	Significant
Problem:	Compiler generates
	``Regex.sml:21.17 Compiler Bug: abstractBody.abstractType 1''
		Note: this is somewhat delicate to reproduce.  If you
		break the following into files and start a clean sml
		and do "use Regex.sml;" it consistently generates
		the error.  However, if you *repeat* the use Regex.sml
		it compiles (however I have a lingering suspision about
		the correctness of the code produced...).
		On one occasion I tried "using" all the files in
		sequence and that worked OK, at least the working
		parts of the module did.

		Also I have tried to cut parts of the Regex.sml
		file and reproduce the error but without success.
		In particular, the error is dependent on at least
		some of the code appearing later in the file.

262. Using the LIBRARY with v0.62
Submitter: "Soren P. Christensen" <schristensen@daimi.aau.dk>
Date: Wed, 8 Aug 90 14:28:49 +0200
Problem:
I just tried to build the library found in /dist/ml/LIBRARY.tar.Z and
this fails.  We are using a spark version of 0.62.  I am not dependent
on the Library and the reson I report this is only so that you can use
it in your testing.

I had to make small changes like the definition of the quit function by
means of cleanup.

1)
   There seems to be problems with the exceptions.

---------------
Transcript:
Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 0.62, 1 August 1990
val it = () : unit
- fn () => (() handle Interrupt=>());
val it = fn : unit -> unit
- exception xx = Interrupt;

std_in:1.7-1.15 Error: unbound variable Interrupt
std_in:1.1-1.15 Error: argument of raise is not an exception
  raised: undef
  in expression:
    raise Interrupt

----------------

2)
   later on it terminates with a runbind, I think this is related to the 
exceptions too.
Comments:
  (1) The Interrupt exception constructor has gone away, and Interrupt
  handling should be replaced by handling the interrupt signal.
  (2) The runbind exception seems to be a genuine bug.

264. No type-explicitness check in nj-sml
Submitter: David Turner <dnt@lfcs.edinburgh.ac.uk>
Date: 7/8/90
Version  : SML of NJ 0.56 and 0.59
System   : Sun
Severity : Dunno, but its pretty anti-social

Problem :

   The compiler doesn't seem to check for type explicitness in
   signatures (see section 5.8 and also rule 65 of the ML definition).
   This means many signatures which can never be matched are still
   accepted as valid signatures.

Transcript :

  - signature X = sig type t val x : t type t end;
  signature X =
    sig
      type t
      val x : ?.t
    end

265. strong type variables accepted in exception declarations
Submitter:      Dave Berry, db@lfcs.ed.ac.uk
Date:		Aug  7 1990
Version:        0.56, 0.59
Severity:       Minor (although it presumably means that the type system
		can be broken!)
Problem:        The compiler doesn't reject applicative type variables
		in exception declarations.
Code:           val id: 'a -> 'a =
		  let exception dummy of 'a
		  in fn x => x
		  end;
Transcript:     The above code produces:
		val id = fn : 'a -> 'a

266. uncaught Io exception in use
From: John Reppy
Date: Mon, 6 Aug 90 18:53:48 EDT
System: 0.62
Problem:
I've noticed the following new (I think) bug.  An Io error in use results
in an uncaught exception.

  Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 0.62, 1 August 1990
  val it = () : unit
  - use "foo";
  [cannot open foo]

  uncaught exception Io "open_in "foo": open failed, No such file or directory"

The problem is that in "use_file" in build/interact.sml (line 307), the
exception Io gets re-raised.  Was this changed for the debugger?
[dbm, 8/30/90] Fixed so that exceptions are handled even for nonterminal
input.

267. sharing again
From: Simon Finn <simon@abstract-hardware-ltd.co.uk>

Problem:
The following program breaks Poly/ML v1.88 and  NJML v0.44a (the most recent version
to which I have access) [breaks d64 as well].
Code:
signature S1 =
sig
  eqtype t

  val y = (A.x = B.C.A.x)
end;

Transcript:
Standard ML of New Jersey, Version d64, ? August 1990

This program is valid, since structure A shares with B.A which shares with B.C.A,
hence A.t and B.C.A.t must be the same (equality) type. However:

268. import, equality
Submitter:      Jason Fischl <fischl@cpsc.ucalgary.ca>
Date:		April 9, 1990
Version:        0.44
System:         Sparcstation 1
Severity:       major

Problem:       

The module system has a bug in it with regard to equality types (I think).
The following is a pretty concise description of what will cause the bug to
occur.  


Code:           
(*-----------------FILE:  term.sig.sml----------------------*)

signature termsig =
sig

datatype term =
    Const of string
  | Var of string
  | Func of string * term list

import "term.sig";

functor termFC ():termsig =

datatype term =
    Const of string
  | Var of string
  | Func of string * term list

end;

(*------------FILE: parse_term.sml---------------------------*)

import "term.sig";

functor parse_termFC (structure TERM:termsig) =
struct

open TERM

fun term_nil x = (x:term list) = []

end;

Comments:

I couldn't find any reference to it in the bug reports so I had to assume it
was all new.  It would have been much nicer if the error message had been a bit
more descriptive.  All I knew was that it was a type problem.  There was no
info as to which line the error occurred on or which function or anything
really. 

I would appreciate a reply at some point if you could manage since I am curious
as to the nature of my problem.  Undoubtedly it will get me again!  

Fix:  

In order to fix the problem I had to define the fun term_nil inside the term
functor and then also put it in the termsig signature.  This took me on the
order of 8 hours to figure out!

272. generalizing user bound type variables
Submitter: Elsa
Date: 9/7/90
Version: 0.65
Problem: user bound variables are occurring in the final type of a function.

   fun f(x) = let val y : 'a -> 'a = x in y y end;
Transcript:     <transcript of session illustrating problem>
   - fun f(x) = let val y : 'a -> 'a = x in y y end;

273. generalizing weak variables inside fn abstractions
Submitter: Dave MacQueen
Date: 10/3/90

Problem: 
  let-bound variables were being generalized with too strong a weak type.
Transcript:
   - val x = fn y => let val f = ref in f end;
   val x = fn : 'a -> '3b -> '3b ref
Comments:
   Second bound type variable should be '2b instead of '3b.

   Added abs field to POLYty constructor to remember abstraction level at
   point where type generalization took place.

276. overriding included value spec

Date: 3/22/90
Version: 0.66
Severity: major
Problem:
    If a value spec in an included signature is redefined in the
    including signature, the value identifier keeps the type
    from the included signature, but it is printed as the type
    from the including signature.

Severity:       Minor (but, should be easy to fix and I would prefer it fixed)

Problem:        

Using 'local ... in ... end' with structures does not work at the top level,
but does work when wrapped in a 'struct ... end' construct

     structure Second : sig val y : int end = Internal

281. Import bombs out when it can't find files.
Submitter:      Richard O'Neill (cmp7130%sys.uea.ac.uk@nsfnet-relay.ac.uk)
Date:		Tue Jul 17 11:01:09 BST 1990
Version:        0.59
System:         Sun3, SunOS 4.1
Severity:       You decide...
Problem:

Importing new files (ones which do not already have a '.bin' file) fails (with
an uncaught exception) whilst attempting to import files which do not exist
produces the same unfriendly message.

Transcript:

unix% ls
file.sml
unix% sml
Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 0.59, 4 June 1990
- import "file";

uncaught exception SystemCall
- import "nofile";

uncaught exception SystemCall
-

Perceived Reason:

The timeFile function in sepcomp/importer.sml believes that the SysIO.mtime
function will raise an Io exeption if it cannot find the file. In fact this
exception is never returned by any of the routines in the SysIO module. When
they encounter a problem they raise the SystemCall exception.

Fix (currently untried):

Option 1:

Change the code for timeFile to trap the SystemCall exeption instead of the
Io exception.

e.g.

<PATCH BEGIN>
*** sepcomp/importer.sml.orig   Fri Jun  1 14:08:02 1990
--- sepcomp/importer.sml        Tue Jul 17 10:29:22 1990

        in
          SOME sec
        end

    fun createBinary(indent, filename,
                   statModule: statModule,
--- 159,165 ----
        in
          SOME sec
        end
!         handle (SystemCall _) => NONE

    fun createBinary(indent, filename,
                   statModule: statModule,

<PATCH END>

Option 2:

Create a new exception SysIO wich the module SysIO raises on failure and trap
that. ( This is to my mind better since SystemCall is a rather wide exception
to be trapping ).

282. 'sharable' & 'pervshare' compilers produce different .bin
Submitter:      Richard O'Neill (cmp7130%sys.uea.ac.uk@nsfnet-relay.ac.uk)
Date: 		Mon Jul 23 10:53:45 BST 1990
Version:        0.60
System:         Sun3/50, SunOS 4.1
Severity:       You decide...
Problem: 
Status: R

The '.bin' files produced by the normal and the '-pervshare' versions of the
compiler are different and each 'version' cannot load the other's '.bin' file
reliably.

Perhaps I have built the two versions differently, but I cannot see how since
they were both built at the same time with the same .mo files (compiled with
the 0.59 batch compiler).

Below is a comprehensive transcript which should help in reproducing the bug,
if it can be reproduced...

284. Poor type specification handling in mutually recursive functions.
Submitter:      Richard O'Neill (rmo%sys.uea.ac.uk@nsfnet-relay.ac.uk)
Date:		Tue Aug 14 10:04:21 BST 1990
Version:        0.64, 0.62, 0.56, ...
System:         Sun3/180, SunOS 4.1
Problem:

When processing mutually recursive functions, Sml of NJ's current type
mechanism prefers its own inferred types of functions to those specifically
declared by the user.

Code:
	type 'a foobar = {foo:'a, bar:'a}

	fun Foo (acc : 'a list foobar)  (nil : 'a list) = acc
	  | Foo {foo, bar} (h :: t) = Bar {foo=(h :: foo), bar=bar} t

	and Bar (acc : 'a list foobar)  (nil : 'a list) = acc
	  | Bar {foo, bar} (h :: t) = Foo {foo=foo, bar=(h :: bar)} t

val Bar = fn : {bar:'a list,foo:'a list} -> 'a list -> 'a list foobar
[closing code.sml]
-
- (* One would expect Foo & Bar to have the SAME type *)

Comments:

The type system seems to be deciding on the type of 'Bar' when it encounters
it in the definition of 'Foo', and then sticking to that. Whilst it checks to
see whether the type in the declaration of foo matches the type it has
inferred, it does not change the 'Foo's type to be in line with its 
declaration.

One can work around the problem by making sure that 'Bar' has the desired type
the first time it is encountered. Thus, if Foo is defined as :-

	fun Foo (acc : 'a list foobar)  (nil : 'a list) = acc
	  | Foo {foo,bar} (h :: t) =
		 Bar ({foo=(h :: foo), bar=bar} : 'a list foobar) t

the correct types result :-
	type 'a  foobar = {bar:'a,foo:'a}
	val Foo = fn : 'a list foobar -> 'a list -> 'a list foobar
	val Bar = fn : 'a list foobar -> 'a list -> 'a list foobar

My (ancient) version of Poly/ML also exhibits the same behaviour.

 The files loaded in "use.sml" are indeed necessary to reproduce the

Comments:

[Appel] I tried this on version 0.64 on our dec 5810, and it works fine
(no extraneous "match not exhaustive" messages).  Was yours a profiling
version or something like that?

I tried it on a sun-4 here (version 0.64) and the bug did not show up,
so it's not machine-specific.

291. floating point on sparc
Submitter: Bernard Sufrin
Date: 9/18/90
Version: 0.56
System: Sparc
Problem:
The ``bad'' functions seem to compile incorrectly on Sparc machines
but ok on 68020 machines. Looks like >=0.0 is compiled wrongly, but the
circumstances are mystifying.  Why does the presence of the pair parameter seem
to be critical (offset calculation in the machine-specific code-generator?).

Code:

(* try ??bad(0.0, 0.0) (~0.2) *)

    fun  bad (x, y)  l =
       if l >= 0.0 then  x else bad(x+l, y) (~l);
    fun  alsobad (x, y)  l =
       if l>0.0  orelse  l=0.0 then  x else alsobad(x+l, y) (~l);
    fun  good (x, y)  l =
       if 0.0 <= l then  x else good(x+l, y) (~l);

Comments:

Running the compilation without the -i works on both platforms.
If the interpretor and debugger are truly incompatible, then
makeml should flag it.

293. debug problems
Submitter:     	Todd Knoblock, todd@eecs.umich.edu
Date: 		26 September 1990
Version:	SML 0.65, emacs 18.55.1
System:		Decstation under ultrix and Sun sparc under sunos
Severity:	error message: minor, no output: critical

Synopsis:

I am having two problems with the emacs debug package.

The first is quite minor: on start-up on a non-x-display (like my
terminal at home), emacs reports the following error when loading
sml-init: file mode specification error:
(void-variable-x-button-m-left).

The second is more serious.  When sending to the sml process, I do not
get output until I move (c-x o/c-x b) into the process buffer.  For example, 
if I have this in a buffer

fun f(0) = 1
  | f(x) = x*(f (x-1));

and type c-c c-c, then if sml has not been run before, emacs
will bring up a window, and start it properly.  However, the
only output is 

Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 0.65, 10 September 1990
val it = () : unit
- emacsInit (); cd "/afs/engin.umich.edu/user/t/o/todd/";
[opening /tmp/sml.tmp.a02351]


Once I move into the buffer, then I get the rest of the output:


val f = fn : int -> int
[closing /tmp/sml.tmp.a02351]

If sml is already running, and the window is not visible, then
sending to the buffer does not cause it to become visible.

Comments:

If I disable the debugging code, by removing the two "hooks"
in sml-init, then the interface works as in the past.  I am
running emacs version 18.55.1, and have tried it on two platforms:
decstation under ultrix, and a sparc under sunos.  Finally, it 
appears that the file outdent.el is redundant now, and could be
removed from the distribution.

297. Bits.lshift on Sun4

Version:        Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 0.66, 15 September
1990
System:         Sun4, both SunOS and Mach
Severity:       minor
Problem:

1. Calls to Bits.lshift with constant arguments that should raise
Overflow cause a compiler error message instead.

2. With non-constant arguments, Bits.lshift expressions that should
raise Overflow don't.

Code:

(1)	Bits.lshift(1,30);

(2)	fun lshift (x, y) = Bits.lshift (x, y);
	lshift (1, 30);
	lshift (1000000, 64);

- Bits.lshift (1, 30);
Error: Compiler bug: [SparcCM.ashr]

SIGILL code 0x2

Comments:

[Cooper] The number of bits to shift is evidently being reduced modulo 32.

[jhr] The lshift operation does not raise Overflow (Andrew's
decision).  I'll look at the other problem.

[jhr] When there is a compiler bug (at least in the backend), the
state of the system gets screwed up in such a way that the system core
dumps.  Is it possible to do a better job of cleaning up when a
compiler bug is detected?  An example is (on 0.66/sparc)

  - Bits.lshift (1, 30);
  Error: Compiler bug: [SparcCM.ashr]
  - ();
  SIGILL code 0x2

[appel]  I don't see where the Definition of Standard ML says that lshift
should raise Overflow!

removing any of the enclosing structures makes the bug go away.  This works

Well, after a month of messing about with other things, I finally got arround
to getting sml working the NeXT (my NeXT arrived and so I could work on it at
home). I'll tell you the problem and give my diffs. 

The problem was that, among the various load commands needed in the
executable's header, one is needed to load the c shared library, and this was
ommited (since previously programs weren't *forced* into using the shared
libraries).  Since the load command is always exactly the same, I did a
ghastly hack and substituted the thing in as a constant (array stuffed with
the right hex numbers). This isn't quite the cleanest thing to do, but I was
only concerned with getting it to work for me. (Yeah, I know, I'm lazy...)

Anyway, diffs follow, and it at least it works now...

	Richard,

310. HP Cache flush problem

System:         HP9000/380 (a /300 with go-faster 68040 option)
Severity:       Critical for this system; fairly major overall
Problem:        Bombs with random bus errors or other traps on 68040-based
		HP machines. The build sequence runs, but not much else.
		Maybe it's a problem with saved images or something

Fix:

From: Andy Norman <ange@hplb.hpl.hp.com>

A solution to your problem is to change the caching to 'writethrough' instead
of 'copyback' on the data region of the dumped sml image. i.e.

  chatr -Cd sml

This is documented in the file /etc/newconfig/ReleaseNotes and on the man page
for chatr.

Hope this helps... a bit...

I'm intrigued by your mail about write-through.  Perhaps we can
still use write-back, if we flush the cache whenever the
garbage collector (etc.) moves code around.  There
is a provision in the runtime system to do this for machines
like the MIPS where the i-cache does not track updates to the
data.  Could this be the problem?  (grep for FLUSH in the runtime)

313. poor error message
Submitter: John Reppy (jhr@cs.cornell.edu)
Date: Thu, 20 Jun 91
Version: 0.69
System: 
Severity: minor
Problem: 
I tripped across a poor error message last night.  Assume we have a 7 line
file "xxx.sml" with the following contents:

  (* 1 *)  fun foo () = let
  (* 2 *)        fun bar () = let
  (* 3 *)              val z = 1
  (* 4 *)              in
  (* 5 *)                z
  (* 6 *)              end
  (* 7 *)  val w = 1

The error being that we forgot the body of foo's let.  The error message
that SML/NJ gives is:
Code: 
Transcript: 
  Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 0.69, 3 April 1991
  val it = () : unit
  - use "xxx.sml";
  [opening xxx.sml]
  xxx.sml:7.19 Error: syntax error found at EOF
  [closing xxx.sml]
  - 
Comments: 
When foo is in the middle of a 1000 line file, figuring out the source
of the error becomes quite hard.  If the error message had the line range, 
it would be a lot better.
Fix: perhaps allow specification in mlyacc that a three-token
     insertion should be tried; in this case  "in 0 end"

314. unbalanced brackets on error message

Version: 0.66-0.69
System: 
Severity: minor
Problem: 
Minor bug in 0.66: if you use a non-existent file, the
resulting diagnostic has unbalanced brackets:

Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 0.66, 15 September 1990
val it = () : unit
- use "nonexistent";
[use failed: open_in "nonexistent": open failed, No such file or directory

Here is another example of an error message that doesn't give enough
info:

  user/drawing.sml:9.3-12.5 Error: mismatching datatype spec: pen_val_t

In this case, pen_val_t has ~30 variants; figuring out the mismatch is
a pain.  This is like the problem with large labeled records.

The first argument of blast_write and the argument of blast_read
should be of type outstream and instream respectively.  In system.sig,
they're given types 'outstream * 'a -> unit and 'instream -> 'a making
them polymorphic.  I'm sure there's a reason for this, but I don't
know what it is.

Comments: 
>From Lal George:
The bug seems simple; checkopen.test was complaining if anything other
than vals, exceptions, or structures were defined within a structure! The
problem was only visible if this other thing (e.g., a type declaration)
came before test had a chance to raise NotStale on something else. A 
revised version of test is as follows:

Fix: 
    let fun test (s:symbol) =
	    case Env.look newenv s
	      of VARbind(VALvar{access=PATH(v'::_),...}) =>
		  if v' = v then raise NotStale else ()
	       | CONbind(DATACON{rep=VARIABLE(PATH(v'::_)),...}) =>
		  if v' = v then raise NotStale else ()
	       | STRbind(STRvar{access=PATH(v'::_),...}) =>
		  if v' = v then raise NotStale else ()
	       | _ => ()
Status: Fixed -- however, the fix in 0.69 adds another arm to the
case after the CONbind:

               | CONbind(DATACON{rep=VARIABLEc(PATH(v'::_)),...}) =>
                  if v' = v then raise NotStale else ()

Comments:
  This happen on all the machines mentioned above (nearly
  always via an illegal instruction).

This is clearly a problem with the new CPS stuff, but I'd like to
again point out the other problem: code generation bugs, such as
this one or the shift bug on the sparc, cause the system to get into
some kind of corrupted state, which causes a core dump on the next
top-level definition.  I think that there needs to be a catch-all
exception handler wrapped around code generation stuff, which will
restore things to a reasonable state.
  - John

The problem with System.Unsafe.Weak is that John forgot to make it an
abstraction rather than a Structure.  If this is fixed, haven no longer
dumps core; I would hope shamash wouldn't get wedged either, though I don't
intend to try the experiment!

Andrew

Trying to reproduce a bug that occurs on haven in 67, I typed

open System.Unsafe.Weak;
strong 1;

This should give a typechecking error, but on haven, it causes a Bus Error.
It looks like on shamash it wedges the machine!
I'm investigating further on other machines.

339. type = allowed
Submitter: Nick Rothwell (nick@lfcs.edinburgh.ac.uk)
Date: Nov 8 1990
Version: 
System: 
Severity: minor
Problem: SML/NJ allows the following code
Code: 
   signature S = sig type = end;
Transcript: 
Comments: 
Here, "=" is clearly not standing for the equality predicate (even though
it's not being rebound), so this is illegal.

The status of something like

  signature S =
    sig
      structure T: sig ... end sharing type T.t = T.*
    end;

is less clear. "*" is not allowed as a TyCon, but "T.*" presumably is (even
though no matching signature for "T" would be syntactically possible to
write).

Sender: David.Tarditi@b.gp.cs.cmu.edu
Status: RO

Here are some answers to the questions about parsing in SML/NJ raised
by Nick Rothwell.  First, the processing of infix operators is handled
by an operator precedence parser after parsing is finished.  The ML-Yacc
grammar essentially allows allow any string of legal identifiers in certain
places; the operator precedence parser sorts it out later.  (As a side note,
this make syntactic error correction much harder).  Yes, this means
that we don't have a "pure" LALR grammar, but I don't see any way anyone
could have one with the precedence scheme used in ML.  

The parser deals with "=" and "*" by always regarding them as reserved words.
To put it another way, the lexer always returns separate tokens for these
values.   This reduces our problem to deciding where exactly "=" and "*"
should be permitted to be used in place of identifiers.

The following rules sort this out:

"*" can always be used in place of an identifier, except in the syntactic
    class "TyCon"

"=" can only be used in place of an identifier in an expression.
    Since it cannot be rebound, it cannot be used as an identifier
    in pattern.

As Nick Rothwell has pointed out, there are some mistakes in SML/NJ
where these rules are violated.  To summarize the problems found so
far:

(1) Allows * to be used as TyCon in type specifications.  This is clearly
    illegal SML (see p.  13 of the Definition).

Example:
	sig
	  type *
        end

(2) Allows = to be used as TyCon in type specifications.  Since this
    isn't the equality predicate, this is wrong.

Example:
	sig
	   type =
	end

(3) Doesn't allow "*" to be used as a record label.  This is clearly
    allowed, since "*" is just an identifier.

Example
	{* = 5}

All of these can be fixed by some minor changes to the grammar using by
SML/NJ, without making the grammar ambiguous.

With regard to parsing examples:

(1)  This is complicated, but not ambiguous.  

   val x = {A=B=C=D=E, B=((X=Y), {X=Y}, X=Y), X=Y};

binds  x to a record with fields A,B, and X.  Field A is set to the boolean
value of ((B=C)=D)=E),  Field B is a tuple of type bool * {X:bool} * bool,
and Field X is set to the value of Y.   Thus:

     val B=1 and C=1 and D=true and E=true and X=1 and Y=1
     val x = {A=B=C=D=E,B=((X=Y), {X=Y}, X=Y), X=Y}

gives:

     val x = {A=true,B=(true,{X=1},true),X=1) :
	    {A:bool,B : bool * {X : int} * bool, X : int}
      

(2) This is legal; the Definition says nothing about rebinding the
    precedence of =.  It won't typecheck though, since function types
    are not equality types.

   nonfix =
   val x = = and y = {A= =(=, =), B = =}

(3) This should be illegal, but isn't.  It shows that SML is
    inherently ambiguous for any fixed lookahead k.

   nonfix =
   fun f x = = | f y = case y of 1 => = | 2 => = | f z = =

    The reason is best illustrated with this simpler case

        fun f x = case y of 1 => 1 | f z = 3

    The "| f z = 3" phrase should go with "fun f x", not with
    the case statement clause.  A parser cannot decide this, however,
    until it sees that the "=" is not an "=>".  However, z can be an
    arbitrarily complex pattern, so for fixed lookahead k we can choose
    some pattern that requires lookahead of k+1 tokens.

    There isn't much you can do about this, short of changing the language
    definition.

    The following variant is legal, by the way:

   nonfix =
   fun f x = = |00 stlouis8913372 "" \r\d in:--in: nuucp word: nuucpNUUCP
to the problem of infixes in signatures making
separate parsing and typehcecking passes difficult, it is already
impossible (I think) to separate the parsing and typechecking
completely.  The infix status of an identifier cannot be determined
without the use of static semantics information.

You could separate the passes as:

(1) parsing
(2) typechecking plus parsing of infix identifiers

if you insist on this kind of division.

Subject: ML question
Date: Sun, 21 Apr 91 10:06:44 +0100

I want to define a datatype, with constructors/destructors, for which
the system can be forced to not provide an equality.  I do not think
this is possible.  Here is the application:

The Nuprl term-type is one for which constructors/destructors are
crucial.  But the term-type is defined in such a way that alpha-equal
variants are not represented identically.  So lambda(x.x) and
lambda(y.y) are not the same structure.  So structural equality will
fail on them.

So we define alpha-equality, which respects this equivalence.  But the
problem is that we do not want to discard structural equality
completely.  That is, if we were to add a new disjunct to the Nuprl
term-type:

datatype Term = .......... | Bogus of int -> int

then Term would not be an eq-type, and structural equality would be
inadmissible.  But sometimes I DO want structural equality, like in
hash-consing (and I'm not sure where else, but I don't want to rule
that out).  So I don't want to give it up right now.  So it would be
nice to define a structure which exported a datatype for the
term-type, an equality function which happened to be defined as
structural equality, but in which the term-type was NOT an eqtype.  Is
this possible?

Here is my try - and the problem:

signature ASIG = sig
type t
datatype DNE = D of int | Bogus of t
val op == : DNE * DNE -> bool
infix 4 ==
end;

abstraction A:ASIG = struct
type t = int
datatype DNE = D of int | Bogus of t
fun == (a,b) = (a = b)
end;


If I run (A.D 5)=(A.D 6) the system will happily run it.  But I want
the system to complain about DNE not being an eq-type.

This isn't possible, is it?

appears in the definition of g is purely syntactic (i.e. doesn't
take type checking, and its associated unifications, into account).
Each explicit type variable is associated with with a particular
val/fun declaration, and it should be generalized at that declaration,
if possible.  In this case 'a is associated with the "fun g" declaration,
and we might annotate the definition of f accordingly:

  fun f (e) =  (* using (e:'a) as argument works *)
      foo (fn l => let fun{'a} g (x : 'a) = bar l x
		    in g e
		   end)

This means that the only legal place to generalize 'a would be at the
definition of g.  However, in this case the expression "bar l x"
forces the type of l to be 'a option, meaning that 'a occurs in
the type of the outer lambda bound variable l.  This prevents the
generalization of 'a at "fun g", so there is a conflict.  Thus the
program is not legal, but there should have been an error message
about not being able to generalize 'a at "fun g", where it is
syntactically scoped.  I'll put in a fix to detect this situation
and generate such an error message.

345. export should return a code and have different type
Submitter: ???
Date: Nov 8, 1990
Version: 
System: 
Severity: minor
Problem: 
How come exportFn is string * (string list * string list -> unit) -> unit
instead of string * (string list * string list -> int) -> 'a   ?

I was actually suggesting two things: the function passed as
argument to exportFn should return an exit status and
exportFn itself should "return" 'a rather than unit
because it doesn't return.

Of course, making exportFn's argument return exit status
might break existing programs that use it; I don't know whether
that's important or not at this stage of the game.

If you want to write unix commands in ML, it's important to
be able to set a return code.

350. fvalbind rewrite rule
Submitter: Nick Rothwell (nick@lfcs.edinburgh.ac.uk)
Date: 12 Feb 1991
Version: 
System: 
Severity: minor
Problem: 
Referring to the definition of the `fun' derived form (defn. V4 p68):
there's a rewriting rule for fvalbind's looking like

          <op>var atpat.11 ... atpat.1n <: ty> = exp.1
          <op>var atpat.21 ... atpat.2n <: ty> = exp.2

          <op>var atpat.m1 ... atpat.mn <: ty> = exp.m
                <and fvalbind>

This implicitly suggests that all the function result type constraints
(whichever present) have to be the same. But, this is a *syntactic*
constraint (we're dealing with derived forms, not elaboration rules).
Certainly they have to elaborate to the same type, but surely they may be
distinct syntactically? The above rule outlaws the following

        local
          type INT = int
        in
          fun f 0 : int = 0
            | f 1 : INT = 1

354. SIGILL bug on SPARC
Submitter: John Reppy (jhr@cs.cornell.edu)
Date: June 18 1991
Version: 0.69
System: SPARC
Severity: major
Problem: 
One of our alpha testers encountered a strange Overflow exception in
eXene.  Upon closer examination it turns out that the problem really
is an illegal instruction exception (SIGILL), and that modifications
made to support MACH on the SPARC caused SIGILL to be mapped to Overflow.

Further examination demonstrates that the bug is neither an eXene bug
or CML bug, but is a bug in SML/NJ.  After a lot of testing I've managed
to produce a small (<100 lines) example program, which will cause the
bug on both the SPARC and DECstation 3100.  The fact that this program
uses the timer interrupts to do thread switching is key; if you turn
the signals off, then the bug does not appear.  I also note that the bug
does not seem to appear in my version of 0.68 (0.67 + my changes for
the unsafe callcc); thus I suspect that it was introduced by the
changes made for supporting FP registers.  The example program is
included below; to produce the bug, run the function "go."  It usually
takes about 3-5 minutes to fail on a SPARCstation-1.  For example, the
following run took 2.5 min:

356. size of images generated by import too large
Submitter: Jawahar Malhotra (malhotra%metasoft@bbn.com)
Date: Jan 29, 1991
Version: 
System: 
Severity: 
Problem: 
I recently redesigned a large system so that I could use separate
compilation. I experienced an increase in heap size of
close to 100%. This was a little disturbing and so I investigated
a little. To explain the problem consider the following example:

Say my system consists of 4 modules: A, B, C, D. 
Every functor is in a separate file as is every signature.
To link, I execute 'use "link.sml"'.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
(* link.sml *)

import "a";
import "b";
import "c";
import "d";

structure A = A();
structure B = B(A);
structure C = C(A);
structure D = D(structure X = B
		structure Y = C);
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The files are as follows:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
(* a.sml *)

import "a.sig";

functor A() = 
...
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
(* b.sml *)

import "a.sig";
import "b.sig";

functor B (X:ASIG) : BSIG = 
...
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
(* c.sml *)

import "a.sig";
import "c.sig";

functor C (X:ASIG) : CSIG = 
...
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

...

Building the system as shown above led to LARGE heap sizes (and images
generated by exportML). I suspected that this was due to the
duplicated imports of the same signature file by many sml files.  
For example, "a.sig" is imported by "a.sml", "b.sml", "c.sml". 

To verify this, I wrote a function called "smartImport" which uses
"use" to load files. It maintains an environment of files already
loaded and avoids duplicate loading of files (code appears at end of
message). I then replaced "import" by "smartImport" in all my source
files and rebuilt. I found that the resulting image size was much
smaller. 

The following results were obtained using an actual system with
approx. 40 modules. For both cases, exactly the same source code was
loaded and an image exported using "exportML".

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
						exportML file size
							(bytes)

Without smartImport (regular sep. comp.)	5799968
With smartImport 				3063840
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is quite a significant saving. I would eventually like to have an
improved "import" command; one that can avoid duplicated loading of files.
I'm not so sure the technique I have used (i.e. using file names to
determine if a file has already been loaded) is a general error-free
solution.

A combination of file name and file modification time may be better.
So whenever "import" loads a file, it records the file name and the
file modification time. The next time it encounters this file, it
compares the saved modification time with the file's actual
modification time. If the file is newer, it reloads the file else it
skips the file. 

Has anyone else had such experiences with separate compilation? Any
other suggestions for how to keep the heap size down?

	Here's another bug report, this one relatively minor.  The problem
arises as follows.  I have a build file which imports a bunch of files and

functors to take a parameter where it formerly had none.  But I forgot to
change the build file to plug in an argument.  Here's what I get:

It gives a reasonable message, then an unreasonable one.  I've noticed
versions of this where the "compiler bug" is "tyC" (or something close to
that).

My suspicion is that it has to do with the awful declaration-as-argument

Problem:        A labeled record can have no more than 100 fields
Comments:
I was browsing the typechecker code (typing/typecheck.sml) and I
noticed a constant "val maxFieldNum = 100," which I assume limits
the number of slots a tuple is allowed to have.  It would be best
to avoid such hard-coded limits, but, if they must exist, they
probably should be localized into a single structure, to allow
easy modifications.

Version 0.69 of SML/NJ:

When compiling the following code, an "uncaught exception Subscript"
occurs.  If the number of elements in the tuple is reduced to 100 from
110, the exception no longer occurs.

Problem: 
The two modules that follow were tested independantly and they both worked.
The problem comes when they try and communicate. I have cut the modules
down as much as possible and hope that the exact problem is clear to you
(as it isn't to me!).

I've been playing around with the two modules and found that they work okay in
conjunction with eachother when the datatype node_seq in the NODE_SEQ
module is not recursive.
Code: 
*****************************************************************************
 This is the Hierarchy structure that uses the sequence structure.
******************************************************************************
import "../sequence/sequence";
signature HIERARCHY =
  sig
	type Sequence
	datatype Hierarchy = EmptyHierarchy | Addlevel of Sequence * Hierarchy
  end

functor Hierarchy(structure Node_Seq : NODE_SEQ) : HIERARCHY =
  struct
	type Sequence = Node_Seq.node_seq
	datatype Hierarchy = EmptyHierarchy | Addlevel of Sequence * Hierarchy
  end
******************************************************************************
And this is the Node_Sequence structure.

functor Node_Seq(structure Node : NODE) : NODE_SEQ =
  struct
	type Element = Node.tYpe
	datatype node_seq = NIL | cons of Element * node_seq
  end

This is the file that I 'use' to save typing. I have tried typing it in
manually as well.

366. lookahead
Submitter: Dave Berry <db@lfcs.edinburgh.ac.uk>
Date: Jan 26 1991
Version: 
System: 
Severity: minor
Problem: 
If I type the following simple program to either SML/NJ or Poly/ML, I
get some interesting behaviour:

(lookahead std_in; lookahead std_in);

(I haven't tried this with Poplog ML or Edinburgh ML because they're only
installed on our Suns, which have crashed.)

If I give this program the input

a

it returns the string "a".  This is the behaviour I expect - the first
call looks at the next character but doesn't affect the state of the
stream, so the next call finds the same character.

(If you try this you'll have to type a semi-colon after the program
finishes, because the compiler will read your input.)

However, if I give the following input to the program

<CTRL-D>a

then it still returns "a".  In other words the first call consumes the
end-of-stream marker, changing the state of the stream.  It's not at all
clear to me that this is the desired behaviour.  It's this behaviour
that results in the problem with end_of_stream that I mentioned some weeks
ago, because (end_of_stream i) is defined as (lookahead i = "").

I suggest that lookahead should never change the state of a stream, even
when it finds an end-of-stream marker on an interactive stream.  This
may require some extra state information in the implementation of a 
stream, but that shouldn't be visible to the user.  This would give
more consistent behaviour, and would solve the problem with end_of_stream.
It also means that I could get rid of the InStream and OutStream types
in the Edinburgh library, making it quite a bit simpler to use (and
maintain).

Some interactive programs do have to consume end-of-stream markers on
interactive streams.  This can be done by calling read at the appropriate
place, perhaps using a function like the following:

fun consumeEOS i =
      if InStream.interactive i then
	if end_of_stream i then read i else ""
      else raise NotInteractive i;

The only problem that I can see with this approach is that a program that
tests for end_of_stream won't necessarily consume the end-of-stream marker
with an explicit read, which means that the compiler will read it and exit.
I can think of a couple of ways that an implementation could avoid this.
The first is to consume an end-of-stream marker before reading a new
program, thus requiring the user to type CTRL-D twice to exit (which might
be safer anyway).  The second is to require the user to call a specific
exit function to exit the compiler.  The third is to treat std_in specially,
and to mark when an end-of-stream marker is encountered by a user calling
lookahead as opposed to the compiler calling lookahead.  I don't know
how easy this would be to implement.

To summarise, this gives a consistent behaviour to lookahead, and seems a
far neater way of solving the end_of_stream problem than my previous
suggestion.

371. intmap bug
Submitter: Chet Murthy (murthy@cs.cornell.edu)
Date: 13 Jun 91
Version: 
System: 
Severity: 
Problem: I was using intmap to implement a hash table, and I found what appears
to be a bug.  
Code: 
(* requires intmap.sig and intmap.sml to be loaded
   To see the bug, run "try 477 trace;" and "try 476 trace;"
   the variable longtrace is bound to an even longer trace.

   Each will, for each N in the list, add (N,CTR) to the
   intmap, and then increment CTR.

   Then each will dump the intmap with intMapToList, and compare
   the cardinality of the domain (computed by getting the first
   projection of each pair in the graph given by intMapToList and
   and uniquifying it) to the actual length of the list returned
   by intMapToList.

   The function repeated will print out all the pairs (N,V) such
   that N appears more than once in the graph.  Try
   "repeated 476 trace" and observe that the output is empty,
   whereas "repeated 477 trace" produces "[(29,476),(29,316)]"
   meaning that both pairs showed up in the trace.
   *)

(* splits a list into the first N elts and the tail *)
fun chopList(0,l) = (nil,l)
  | chopList(n,h::t) =
    let val (m,l') = chopList(n-1,t) in
        (h::m,l')
    end


fun member x nil = false
|   member x (h::t) = if x = h then true else member x t

fun uniquize nil = nil
|   uniquize (h::t) = if member h t then uniquize t else h::(uniquize t)

  fun collect f l = fold List.@ (map f l) nil

fun runTo n l =
    let val (pref,_) = chopList(n,l)
        val ctr = ref 0
        val imap = Intmap.new(100,General.Match)
        fun go nil = ()

        (go pref;Intmap.intMapToList imap)
end

fun try n trace = uniquize(map #1 (runTo n trace))

The SML definition of div and mod is different than that typically provided
by hardware, thus mod and div actually defined as

    fun op div(a:int,b:int):int =
                if a>=0
                    then if b>=0 then InLine.div(a,b)

                                 else InLine.div(a,b)
    fun op mod(a:int,b:int):int = a-(a div b)*b

(see boot/perv.sml).  The "*" in mod is causing the overflow.  You could
use quot and rem, but they may not give you the answer you want:

    - ~1073741824 rem 10;

The easiest way to reproduce the Runbind exception is to try to load
the portable version of the SML library into SML 0.69. I've also had
it occur when I was doing something with returning options, but that
code doesn't exist anymore (I changed the structure of the code and

379. redundant patterns
Submitter: John Reppy (jhr@cs.cornell.edu)
Date: Jan 25 1991
Version: 
System: 
Severity: 
Problem: 
I would like to suggest that the compiler reject redundant patterns as
errors (possibly with a flag to generate only warnings to preserve
compatibility with "The Definition").  The reason for this change is
that it will force the user to deal with potential errors (warning
messages usually get buried in the output).  Often, a redundant pattern
is the result of a mis-spelled constructor name, and so is actually an
error (there is an example of this in the 0.67 version of the debugger).

381. saving registers for signal handler continuation
Submitter: Andrew Tolmach (apt@princeton.edu)
Date: 14 may 1991
Version: 0.69
System: 
Severity: major
Problem: 
Andrew Tolmach discovered an interesting bug, which he and I traced
further.  Summary:

At a heap-limit check (typically an add-to-limit-causing-overflow),
there are two kinds of general-purpose registers:

1.  Live Pointers or Tagged Integers.  These get a 1 in the register mask.
2.  Dead Pointers, Live Untagged Integers, or anything else. 
     These get a 0.

Thus, a 0 in the mask does NOT indicate "dead."  Registers with a 1
in the mask should be forwarded (if pointers) by the G.C., and
registers with a 0 should be preserved unchanged.

Unfortunately, the function "make_ml_sigh_arg" was not preserving the 
0-in-the-mask registers, so that the string-creation function create_s
was losing a register if a signal occurred.

Is having ml_sigh_arg preserve all registers the right thing to do ?
Maybe we should enforce the invariant that a 0 in the mask
indicates "dead" ?   The argument for doing this is that it
makes signal handling cheaper in both time and space.  Right now,
make_ml_sigh_arg only has to save the number of used registers.
It scans each bit in the mask to determine which registers to
save until the remainder of the mask is 0, so it takes less time also,
if live registers tend to be the lower numbered registers (as they do
with the current register allocator).

The argument for not doing this is that is allows us to do
"representation analysis", i.e. place untagged integers in
registers across procedure boundaries.  I don't know what
the performance gain from this will be.

   Dave

From: Andrew Appel <appel@Princeton.EDU>
John Reppy has found that signal-handling overhead isn't too bad
(3% for 20-millisecond timer interrupts on a SPARC), and saving
a few extra register shouldn't make a huge difference.
I would certainly hate to rule out passing untagged integers across
procedure boundaries.

384. signal handler never re-installed
Submitter:    Manuel Fahndrich (mf39@andrew.cmu.edu)
Date:         6/4/91
Version:      0.66 0.67
System:       DECstation 3100 (Mach and BSD UNIX 4.3)
Problem:      The signal handlers only get called the first time they are
              installed. Once setHandler(signal, NONE) is executed and then
              setHandler(signal, SOME handler), the signal is ignored.
              Tested on signals (SIGIO, SIGINT, SIGALRM)

Transcript:   fun ioh (_, k) = (print "SIGIO\n"; k);
              System.Signals.setHandler (System.Signals.SIGIO, SOME ioh);
              <ok, this works>
              System.Signals.setHandler (System.Signals.SIGIO, NONE);
              <ok, ignored>
              System.Signals.setHandler (System.Signals.SIGIO, SOME ioh);
              <wrong, still ignored!!!>

Comment:      The inqHandler returns the correct handler function at the end.
[jgm] The following code really exercises the bug:

  open System.Signals;
  setHandler(SIGINT, NONE);
  inqHandler(SIGINT);
  (* core dumps *)

Code for setHandler and inqHandler is simple enough to figure that the
bug is probably in the code generator -- it's broken on Mach and Irix,
so the OS is not to blame.  Also, ripping the signal handling code
in perv.sml out and compiling it on top of the pervasives makes the
bug go away.

(1) Suppose we do :

open System.Signals;
open System.Timer;
val setitimer = System.Unsafe.CInterface.setitimer;
fun setTimer msec =  (setitimer(0,TIME{sec=0,usec=1000*msec}, 
				   TIME{sec=0,usec=1000*msec}));
setHandler(SIGALRM,SOME(fn (_,k) => (print "hi!\n";k)));
setTimer 500;

This will print hi! twice a second (on cs or elan) or (roughly speaking) 
when return is hit (on haven), more or less as expected.

(2) Now suppose we do :

setHandler(SIGALRM,NONE); 
setHandler(SIGALRM,SOME(fn (_,k) => (print "lo!\n";k)));

On all machines, this has no visible effect; that is, lo! is not printed.

(3) But if we then do:

System.Unsafe.CInterface.c_function "enablesig" (3,true);

we do start seeing lo! just as we saw hi! before.


Finally, and most excitingly, if we do (1) followed by:

setHandler(SIGALRM,NONE); 
inqHandler SIGALRM;

we get the following results:

on haven and k2 (both versions):

Bus Error

on elan:

- Fixed up unaligned data access for pid 16679 (sml) at pc 0x417ed0

on cs:

385. SIGHUP, SIGQUIT, SIGTERM ignored sometimes
Submitter: Mark Foster (mark@central.cis.upenn.edu)
Date: Nov 15 1990
Version: 0.66
System: 
Severity: minor
Problem: 
It appears that some signals get ignored when they shouldn't.
In particular, SIGHUP SIGQUIT and SIGTERM don't get properly delivered
when the parent process of sml exits in certain ways.  As a result,
the sml process remains, sometimes dormant, and sometimes in a spin
loop (continuous select() calls, trying to output a message, but it
can't because it's psuedo tty is "gone").

The easiest way we've found to demonstrate the problem is via telnet

	% telnet me
	Trying 127.0.0.1 ...
	Connected to LOCALHOST.UPENN.EDU.
	Escape character is '^]'.

	(login stuff deleted)
	% sml
	Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 0.66, 15 September 1990
	val it = () : unit
	-

now, escape back to telnet, then close the connection
	^]
	telnet> c

the sml process does not exit.

WORKAROUNDS:

We have two possible workarounds to this problem.  Fundamentally, the
output that's trying to happen probably needs to be fixed.  Either
to detect when it cannot successfully output or to just give up at some
point.  The following two approaches don't do fix the problem, they just 
bandaid around it.  Both methods "cure" the problems we've been 
experiencing.

Method 1:
Change runtime/signal.c to disallow redefining of the signals used to
shutdown a child process

>                                     SETSIG (sig, sig_handler, SIGMASK);
>                                   }
>               break;
234c238,241
<           SETSIG (sig, sig_handler, SIGMASK);
---
>         if ((sig != SIGQUIT) &&
>             (sig != SIGHUP) && (sig != SIGTERM)) {
>             SETSIG (sig, sig_handler, SIGMASK);
>           }


Method 2:
Change boot/perv.sml to not attempt to output a message on quit

% diff perv.sml.orig perv.sml
1871,1873c1871
<     fun quit s _ = (
<         output(std_err, s); output(std_err, " (no coredump)\n");

I've seen this effect, but I never thought about it enough
to realize what was going on.  His first solution is an
awkward way to say the ML can't handle SIGHUP, SIGQUIT
and SIGTERM; I like to avoid that.  His second solution is
better; but there probably should be a warning somewhere
abut the problems with SIGHUP.

I think that this problem is a bug in the way select works.  If you do
a select on a closed file, it fails with EBADF; I think it should do the
same if the ptty has gone away.  But we live in an imperfect world, so
I recommend the following fix:

Replace the function quit (at the end of perv.sml) with the following
code:

    fun quit s _ = let val msg = (s ^ " (no coredump)\n\000")
	  in
	  (* use write, since IO.output will block if we've lost the ptty *)
	    System.Unsafe.SysIO.write(2, System.Unsafe.cast msg, size msg)
	      handle _ => ();
	    System.Unsafe.CleanUp.shutdown()

Problem: type abbreviations not transparent

	-
Comments:
  Interestingly enough, this doesn't seem to happen when you have a unary
  type abbreviation like
	type 'a bogus = int

  The problem seems to boil down to WHEN you project through abbreviations
  (i.e. when you do the "macro" expansion).  There seems to be at least two
  possibilities, project through before a unification containing this type,
  or attempt to unify with this type and project through only if this fails.
  As long as every argument to the type abbreviation also appears in the
  expanded form, the two are equivalent.  When an argument DOESN'T appear in
  expanded form, the second approach (which is the approach currently
  being used) causes problems.  As is evident in the above example, it
  causes the typechecker to unify things which should not be unified.

  The following code from unify.sml (in unifyTy) is where the problem is:
	   | (CONty(tycon1, args1), CONty(tycon2, args2)) =>
	       if eqTycon(tycon1, tycon2)
----->	       then unifyArgs(args1, args2)
	       else (unifyTy(reduceType ty1, ty2)
		     handle ReduceType =>
		       unifyTy(ty1, reduceType ty2)
		       handle ReduceType => raise Unify("tycon mismatch"))

  The point marked is where the damage is done.  If both types have the same
  abbreviation constructor, unification will blithely go ahead and try to
  unify ALL of the arguments, even though some of them might be irrelevant
  because they are unused.

Fix:
  Three possibilities:
    1. Decide that this is a "feature", that you really don't want
       (int,int) bogus to unify with (int,int list) bogus.  However,
       I would argue that if this is what you want, you should be using
       the datatype facility, not the type facility.
    2. Forbid type abbreviations which do not use all their arguments.
       This is somewhat unsatisfying since, although human programmers
       will probably not produce abbreviations like this, it is easy
       to imagine automatic programming utilities (like Lex or Yacc) that
       MIGHT produce such code.
    3. Perform abbreviation expansion BEFORE unifying an abbreviated
       type with anything except a type variable (you would want to
       unify the type variable with the abbreviated type so that
       it can be printed correctly).  The best way to do this is
       probably to define a new constructor for the type "ty" called
       something like ABBREVty of tycon * tylist * ty where the
         tycon is the abbreviation constructor
         tylist are the constructor's arguments
         and ty is the "macro expanded" type

       Then, in unifyTy, you could have (right after the two VARty clauses)
	  | (ABBREVty(_,_,ty),_) => unifyTy(ty,ty2)
	  | (_,ABBREVty(_,_,ty)) => unifyTy(ty1,ty)
       to project through the abbreviation appropriately.

       The catch to this is that you can then produce circular types
       so you would have to perform an occur check during type printing.
       For instance, consider the following:
		type ('a,'b) bogus;
		fun f (x:'b,y:('a,'b) bogus) = ();
                fun g x = f (x,x);
       What is the type of g?  Really, it's 'a->unit but internally
       it's something like (pardon the abuse of notation):
		ABBREVty(bogus,['a,*],'a) --> unit
       where the * marks a circular reference back to the ABBREVty object.
       Obviously, a naive attempt to print this type will infinite loop--
       hence the requirement for an occur check during type printing.

395. weakness constraing problem
Submitter: John Reppy (jhr@cs.cornell.edu)
Date: Mar 18 1991
Version:
System:
Severity:
Problem:
I'm having trouble with a weakness constraint, and I don't understand it.
I have a function at top-level of a module, which the typechecker gives
the type

    val attach : 'aU CML.chan * widget_t * mbutton_t * 'aU menu_t -> widget_t

My memory is that the 'aU is an internal type variable?  Anyway, attach
calls another function taht also has an 'aU in its type; by adding a
type constraint to the other function, then things compile.  Anyway,
this seems like a bug (and I think I've run into it before).

Andrew Tolmach discovered the following bug, and I've tracked it down.
Unsafe.update is unreliable on the MIPS when the value stored is a constant.

next version; in the meantime, use Array.update.

401. Imperative types in SML/NJ 0.66
Submitter: Dave Berry <db@lfcs.edinburgh.ac.uk>
Date: 14 Feb 91 
Version: 0.66
System:
Severity: 
Problem: 
The following program compiles under Poly/ML 1.86, but fails to compile
under SML/NJ 0.66.


fun create (x:int) (y:'_a) :'_a Array.array = Array.array (x, y)

type ('a,'b) table = ('a*int*'b) list Array.array

val defaultSize = 97

fun createDefault (sample'value :'_a) :(string, '_a) table =
  let val mt = [] : (string * int * '_a) list
  in create defaultSize mt
  end


It will compile if Array.array is used directly in place of the curried
version.  It will also compile if createDefault is given an extra parameter,
either before or after the existing one.

This is the simplest example I've run across of SML/NJ failing to type
correct SML use of imperative types. It's fairly simple in this case -
it only took me a day to get the case this simple - but I've come across
at least one other example that I've just given up on.

I remember Dave MacQueen and mads Tofte discussing a bug in the SML/NJ
algorithm at the Edinburgh Workshop.  Is there any chance of a fix?

Dave.
