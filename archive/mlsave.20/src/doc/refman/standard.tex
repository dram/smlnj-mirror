\chapter{Standard bindings}
The initial top-level environment is comprised of a set of standard
bindings; the ``core'' bindings are described in this chapter, and
all bindings are described in Appendix~\ref{library}

The language provides the record type constructor 
$ \verb"{" {\bf lab}_1 \verb":" {\bf ty}_1 , \underline{\ \ \ }
 , {\bf lab}_n \verb":" {\bf ty}_n \verb"}"$ for any set 
$\{ {\bf lab}_i \} $ of labels and corresponding set 
$\{ {\bf ty}_i \} $ of types.  The language also provides the infixed
function-type constructor \verb"->".  Otherwise, type constructors
are postfixed.  The following are standard:

\begin{description}
\item[Type {\em constants} (nullary constructors):]  unit, bool, exn, int,
real, string
\item[Unary type constructors:]  list, ref
\end{description}

The constructors unit, bool, and list are fully defined by the
following assumed declaration
\begin{verbatim}
infixr 5 ::
type unit = {}
datatype    bool = true | false
datatype  'a list = nil |  :: of {1 : 'a, 2 : 'a list}
\end{verbatim}

The word ``unit'' is chosen since the type contains just one value
``\verb"{}"'', the empty record.  This is why it is preferred to the
word ``void'' of Algol-68.

The type constants \verb"int", \verb"real", and \verb"string"
are equipped with special
constants as described in section 2.3.  The type constructor
\verb"ref" is for constructing reference types; see
Chapter~\ref{reference}.
The type constant \verb"exn" is the type of all exceptions, and
is a datatype containing an unbounded number of constructors
generated by \verb"exception" bindings (see Chapter~\ref{exception}).

All standard functions, constants, and exceptions are listed in
Appendix~\ref{library}.
