This is a grammar for Berkeley Pascal, hacked to be SLR, though that is
not necessary because ML-Yacc supports LALR(1).

To load it, first load base.sml, the standard background for ML-Yacc, into
Standard ML.  Then change to this directory and load the files
pascal.grm.sig, pascal.grm.sml, pascal.lex.sml, and join.sml.

Those using Standard ML of New Jersey can do this by invoking Standard ML in
the root directory for ML-Yacc and typing the following commands at the
Standard ML of New Jersey prompt (the % sign):

	%use "base.sml"
	%System.cd "examples/pascal"
	%use "load.sml"

The pascal parser can be invoked by applying the parse function that 
from loading these files to a string containing the name of a file.  The
subdirectory test contains some sample files, some with intentional syntax
errors.
