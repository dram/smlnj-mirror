Version 4, September 25

Changed from version 3:
The runtime system is completely converted to the new tag system:
    * got rid of the NEWTAGS #define in runtime;
    * added the correct tags to data defined in the runtime system.
A bug in floating point exceptions on the M68 was fixed.
Fixed up compile a bit; somehow toggle was the old version.
Added new debug info to the garbage collector, flag GCDEBUG.
Added a function Lsave to compile which toggles flags so % works right.
Added a function dumpMap to invoke and compile which prints out the mapping
      of lvars to structures.
Fixed a subtle bug in BasicIO.input;  note that this input is non-standard,
      since it raises io_failure when applied to a closed stream, while
      the standard specifies that it should return "".  The same may
      be true of lookahead and input_line.  Also input should check for
      a negative count.
Changed to the new string format.
Added refs to profile counting.

Known bugs:
<val it> is still broken.
Unhoisted linked code seems broken.
