\chapter{The standard library}
\label{library}

A standard set of values, types, exceptions, etc. are {\em
pervasive}---they are in the initial environment and available in
every structure.  This {\em standard library} is grouped into
structures; each structure deals with the operations on one or two
abstract types.  The signature of each of these modules, with an
informal explanation of the semantics, is given in this chapter.

\begin{verbatim}
signature GENERAL =
  sig
    infix 3 o
    infix before
    exception Bind
    exception Match
    exception Interrupt
    val o : ('b -> 'c) * ('a -> 'b) -> ('a -> 'c)
    val before : ('a * 'b) -> 'a
    val system : string -> unit
    val cd : string -> unit
    exception Equal
    datatype 'a option = NONE | SOME of 'a
    type exn
    type unit
  end

abstraction General : GENERAL
\end{verbatim}
The structure \verb"General" contains various miscellaneous and
general-purpose values, types, and exceptions.  The type \verb"exn"
is the type of all exceptions.

\section{List}
\begin{verbatim}
signature LIST =
  sig
    infixr 5 :: @
    datatype 'a list = :: of ('a * 'a list) | nil
    exception Hd
    exception Tl
    exception Nth
    val hd : 'a list -> 'a
    val tl : 'a list -> 'a list 
    val null : 'a list -> bool 
    val length : 'a list -> int 
    val @ : 'a list * 'a list -> 'a list
    val rev : 'a list -> 'a list 
    val map :  ('a -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b list
    val fold : (('a * 'b) -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b -> 'b
    val revfold : (('a * 'b) -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b -> 'b
    val app : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a list -> unit
    val revapp : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a list -> unit
    val nth : 'a list * int -> 'a 
    val exists : ('a -> bool) -> 'a list -> bool
  end
\end{verbatim}
The semantics of this module are defined by the
following implementation.
\begin{verbatim}
abstraction List: LIST =
  struct
    infixr 5 :: @ 
    infix 6 + -
    datatype 'a list = :: of ('a * 'a list) | nil
    exception Hd
    fun hd (a::r) = a | hd nil = raise Hd
    exception Tl
    fun tl (a::r) = r | tl nil = raise Tl    
    fun null nil = true | null _ = false
    fun length nil = 0 | length (a::r) = 1 + length r
    fun op @ (nil,l) = l | op @ (a::r, l) = a :: (r@l)
    fun rev l = let fun f (nil, h) = h 
                      | f (a::r, h) = f(r, a::h)
                in  f(l,nil)
                end
    fun map f = let fun m nil = nil | m (a::r) = f a :: m r
                in  m
                end
    fun fold f = let fun f2 nil = (fn b => b)
                       | f2 (e::r) = (fn b => f(e,(f2 r b)))
                 in  f2
                 end
    fun revfold f l = fold f (rev l)
    fun app f l = (map f l; ())
    fun revapp f l = app f (rev l)
    exception Nth
    fun nth(e::r,0) = e 
      | nth(e::r,n) = nth(r,n-1)
      | nth _ = raise Nth
    fun exists f =
          let fun g nil = false | g (h::t) = f h orelse g t
          in  g
          end
  end
\end{verbatim}
\section{Array}
\begin{verbatim}
signature ARRAY =
  sig
    infix 3 sub
    type 'a array
    exception Subscript
    val array : int * '1a -> '1a array
    val sub : 'a array * int -> 'a
    val update : 'a array * int * 'a -> unit
    val length : 'a array -> int
    val arrayoflist : 'a list -> 'a array
  end
\end{verbatim}
Arrays may be made whose elements are any type.  \verb"array(n,x)"
returns a new array of $n$ elements, indexed from $0$ to $n-1$,
initialized to $x$.  \verb"a sub i" returns the $i^{th}$ element of
the array $a$.  \verb"update(a,i,z)" sets the $i^{th}$ element of the
array $a$ to the value $z$.

Two arrays are equal if and only if they are the same array (created
with the same call to \verb"array"); except that all arrays of length
0 may be equal to each other, depending on the implementation.

The following implementation defines the semantics of arrays, though
in practice arrays are implemented much more efficiently.
\begin{verbatim}
abstraction Array : ARRAY =
  struct
   type 'a array = 'a ref list
   exception Subscript
   fun array(0,x) = nil | array(n,x) = ref x :: array(n-1,x)
   fun a sub i = !(nth(a,i)) handle Nth => raise Subscript
   fun update(a,i,z) = nth(a,i) := z handle Nth => raise Subscript
   fun length a = List.length a
   fun arrayoflist l = l
  end
\end{verbatim}
\section{Input/Output}
The input/output primitives are intended as a simple basis that may
be compatibly superseded by a more comprehensive I/O system that
provides for streams of arbitrary type or a richer repertoire of I/O
operations.  The IO structure contains all I/O primitives; this
structure will in all implementation
match (with thinning) the BASICIO signature provided
below, but may contain other primitives as well.

\begin{verbatim}
signature BASICIO = 
  sig
    type instream 
    type outstream
    exception Io_failure of string
    val std_in : instream
    val std_out : outstream
    val open_in : string -> instream
    val open_out : string -> outstream
    val close_in : instream -> unit
    val close_out : outstream -> unit
    val output : outstream -> string -> unit
    val input : instream -> int -> string
    val lookahead : instream -> string
    val end_of_stream : instream -> bool
  end

\end{verbatim}
The type \verb"instream" is the type of input streams and the type
\verb"outstream" is the type of output streams.  The exception
\verb"Io_failure" is used to represent all of the errors that may
arise in the course of performing I/O.  The value associated with
this exception is a string representing the type of failure.  In
general, any I/O operation may fail if, for any reason, the host
system is unable to perform the requested task.  The value associated
with the exception should describe the type of failure, insofar as
this is possible.

The standard prelude binds \verb"std_in" to an instream and
\verb"std_out" to an outstream.  For interactive ML processes, these
are expected to be associated with the user's terminal.  However, an
implementation that supports the connection of processes to streams
may associate one process's \verb"std_in" to another's
\verb"std_out".

The \verb"open_in" and \verb"open_out" primitives are used to
associate a disk file with a stream.  The expression
\verb"open_in(s)" creates a new instream whose producer is the file
named \verb"s" and returns that stream as a value.
Similarly, \verb"open_out(s)" creates a new \verb"outstream"
associated with the file \verb"s", and returns that stream.

The \verb"input" primitive is used to read characters from a stream.
Evaluation of \verb"input s n" causes the removal of \verb"n"
characters from the input stream \verb"s".  If fewer than \verb"n"
characters are currently available, then the ML system will block
until they become available from the producer associated with
\verb"s"\footnote{The exact definition of ``available'' is
implementation-dependent.  For instance, operating systems typically
buffer terminal input on a line-by-line basis so that no characters
are available until an entire line has been typed.}.
If the end of stream is reached while processing an \verb"input",
fewer than \verb"n" characters may be returned.  
Attempting \verb"input" from a closed stream raises
\verb"Io_failure".

The function \verb"lookahead(s)" returns the next character on
\verb"instream s" without removing it from the stream.  Input streams
are terminated by the \verb"close_in" operation.  This primitive is
provided primarily for symmetry and to support the re-use of
unused streams on resource-limited systems.  The end of an input
stream is detected by \verb"end_of_stream", a derived form that is
defined as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
fun end_of_stream(s) = (lookahead(s)="")
\end{verbatim}

Characters are written to an \verb"outstream" with the \verb"output"
primitive.  The string argument consists of the characters to be
written to the given outstream.  The function \verb"close_out" is
used to terminate an output stream.  Any further attempts to output
to a closed stream cause \verb"Io_failure" to be raised.

\begin{verbatim}
(* Extended IO *)
    structure BasicIO : BASICIO
    val execute : string -> BasicIO.instream * BasicIO.outstream
    val flush_out : BasicIO.outstream -> unit
    val can_input : BasicIO.instream * int -> bool
    val input_line : BasicIO.instream -> string
    val open_append : string -> BasicIO.outstream
    val is_term_in : BasicIO.instream -> bool
    val is_term_out : BasicIO.outstream -> bool
\end{verbatim}

In addition to the basic I/O primitives, provision is made for some
extensions that are likely to be provided by many implementations.
The functions listed above are provided by Standard ML of New Jersey.

The function \verb"execute" is used to create a pair of streams, one an
\verb"instream" and one an \verb"outstream", and associate them with
a process.  The string argument to \verb"execute" is the
operating-system command that starts the process.

The function \verb"flush_out" ensures that the consumer associated
with an \verb"out_stream" has received all of the characters
associated with that stream.  It is provided primarily to allow the
ML user to circumvent undesirable buffering characteristics that may
arise in connection with terminals and other processes.  All output
streams are flushed when they are closed, and in many implementations
an output stream is flushed whenever a newline character is written
if that stream is connected to a terminal.

The function \verb"can_input" returns the number of characters
which may be read from its instream argument without blocking.
For instance, a command processor may wish
to test whether or not a user has typed ahead in order to avoid an
unnecessary prompt.  The exact definition of ``currently available''
is implementation specific, perhaps depending on such things as the
processing mode of a terminal.

The \verb"input_line" primitive returns a string consisting of the
characters from an \verb"instream" up through, and including, the
next end of line character.  If the end of stream is reached without
reaching an end of line character, all remaining characters from the
stream ({\em without} an end of line character) are returned.

Files may be open for output while preserving their contents by using
the \verb"open_append" primitive.  Subsequent \verb"output" to the
outstream returned by this primitive is appended to the contents of
the specified file.

Basic support for the complexities of terminal I/O are provided.  The
pair of functions \verb"is_term_in" and \verb"is_term_out" test
whether or not a stream is associated with a terminal.  These
functions are especially useful with \verb"std_in" and \verb"std_out"
because they are opened as part of the standard prelude.  A terminal
may be associated with a stream using the ordinary \verb"open_in" and
\verb"open_out" functions; the naming convention to do this is
implementation-dependent.  Terminal I/O is, in general, more complex
than ordinary file I/O.   In most cases the \verb"ExtendedIO" module
provided by an implementation will have additional operations to
support mode control.  Since the details of such control operations
are highly host-dependent, the functions that may be provided are
left unspecified.
\section{Bool}
\begin{verbatim}
signature BOOL =
  sig
    datatype bool = true | false
    val not: bool -> bool
    val print: bool -> bool
    val makestring: bool -> string
  end
\end{verbatim}
These are quite straightforward, and can be defined as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
abstraction Bool: BOOL =
  struct
    datatype bool = true | false
    fun not true = false | not false = true
    fun makestring true = "true" | makestring false = "false"
    fun print b = (output(std_out, makestring b); b)
  end
\end{verbatim}
\section{ByteArray}
\begin{verbatim}
signature BYTEARRAY =
  sig
    infix 3 sub
    type bytearray
    exception Subscript
    exception Range
    val array : int * int -> bytearray
    val sub : bytearray * int -> int
    val update : bytearray * int * int -> unit
    val length : bytearray -> int
    val extract : bytearray * int * int -> string
    val fold : ((int * 'b) -> 'b) -> bytearray -> 'b -> 'b
    val revfold : ((int * 'b) -> 'b) -> bytearray -> 'b -> 'b
    val app : (int -> 'a) -> bytearray -> unit
    val revapp : (int -> 'b) -> bytearray -> unit
  end
\end{verbatim}
Byte arrays are just like arrays of integers, with the restriction
that the values of the component integers must be between 0 and 255.
The intent is that the implementation may store them more efficiently
than the equivalent array.

Note that, by default, the ByteArray structure is present but 
not opened in the 
initial environment.  The declaration \verb"open ByteArray" may be
used to open it.

Their semantics can be defined by this implementation:
\begin{verbatim}
abstraction ByteArray : BYTEARRAY =
  struct
    infix 3 sub
    type bytearray = int array
    exception Subscript = Array.Subscript
    exception Range
    fun check x = if x<0 orelse x>255 then raise Range else ()
    fun array(i,x) = (check x; Array.array(i,x))
    val length = Array.length
    fun update(a,i,x) = (check x; Array.update(a,i,x))
    val op sub = Array.sub
    fun extract(b,i,0) = if i<0 orelse i>length(b)
                          then raise Subscript  else ""
      | extract(b,i,n) = chr(b sub i) ^ extract(b,i,n-1)
    val fold =  . . .
    val revfold =  . . .
    val app = ...
    val revapp = ...
  end
\end{verbatim}

\section{Integer}
\begin{verbatim}
signature INTEGER = 
  sig
    infix 7 * div mod
    infix 6 + -
    infix 4 > < >= <=
    exception Div
    exception Mod
    exception Overflow
    type int
    val ~ : int -> int
    val * : int * int -> int
    val div : int * int -> int
    val mod : int * int -> int
    val + : int * int -> int
    val - : int * int -> int
    val >  : int * int -> bool
    val >= : int * int -> bool
    val <  : int * int -> bool
    val <= : int * int -> bool
    val min : int * int -> int
    val max : int * int -> int
    val abs : int -> int
    val print : int -> int
    val makestring : int -> string
  end
\end{verbatim}
This should be mostly self-explanatory.
The function \verb"div" raises \verb"Div" on divide by zero,
otherwise \verb"Overflow" if the result doesn't fit;  similarly
\verb"mod" may raise \verb"Mod" or \verb"Overflow".  Other operators
may raise \verb"Overflow" if the result doesn't fit into their
representation.  Implementations
may use infinite-precision integers, in which case \verb"Overflow"
won't be raised.  Finite precision implementations should allow
integers of at least 30 bits.  The author recommends that
infinite-precision be added as a separate package.
\section{Real}
\begin{verbatim}
signature REAL =
  sig
    infix 7 * /
    infix 6 + -
    infix 4 > < >= <=
    type real
    exception Floor and Sqrt and Exp and Ln
    exception Float of string
    val ~ : real -> real 
    val + : (real * real) -> real 
    val - : (real * real) -> real 
    val * : (real * real) -> real 
    val / : (real * real) -> real 
    val > : (real * real) -> bool
    val < : (real * real) -> bool
    val >= : (real * real) -> bool
    val <= : (real * real) -> bool
    val abs : real ->  real
    val real : int -> real
    val floor : real -> int
    val sqrt : real -> real
    val sin : real -> real
    val cos : real -> real
    val arctan : real -> real
    val exp : real -> real
    val ln : real -> real
    val print : real -> real
    val makestring : real -> string
  end
\end{verbatim}
\section{Ref}
\begin{verbatim}
signature REF = 
  sig
    infix 3 :=
    val ! : 'a ref -> 'a
    val := : 'a ref * 'a -> unit
    val inc : int ref -> unit
    val dec : int ref -> unit
  end
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
abstraction Ref : REF = 
  struct
    fun ! (ref x) = x
    val := (* not explainable in terms of other primitives *)
    fun inc (x as ref i) = x := i+1
    fun dec (x as ref i) = x := i-1
  end
\end{verbatim}
\section{String}
\begin{verbatim}
signature STRING =
  sig
    infix 6 ^
    infix 4 > < >= <=
    type string
    exception Substring
    val length : string -> int
    val size : string -> int
    val substring : string * int * int -> string
    val explode : string -> string list
    val implode : string list -> string
    val <= : string * string -> bool
    val <  : string * string -> bool
    val >= : string * string -> bool
    val >  : string * string -> bool
    val ^  : string * string -> string
    exception Chr
    val chr : int -> string 
    exception Ord
    val ord : string -> int 
    val ordof : string * int -> int 
    val print : string -> string
  end
\end{verbatim}
Strings can be explained by the implementation below; though in
practice a more efficient implementation will often be used.
\begin{verbatim}
abstraction String : STRING =
  struct
    infix 6 ^
    infix 4 > < >= <=
    type string = int list
    exception Substring
    val length = List.length
    val size = length
    fun substring(s,0,0) = nil
      | substring(a::b,0,len) = a::substring(b,0,len-1)
      | substring(nil,_,_) = raise Substring
      | substring(a::b,i,len) = substring(b,i-1,len)
    fun explode nil = nil
      | explode (i::l) = [i] :: explode l
    fun implode nil = nil
      | implode (s::l) = s @ implode l
    fun (_::_) > nil = true
      | nil > (_::_) = false
      | (i::r) > (j::s) = Integer.>(i,j) orelse i=j andalso r>s
    fun a <= b = not (a>b)
    fun a < b = b > a
    fun a >= b = b <= a
    val op ^ = op @
    exception Chr
    fun chr i = if i<0 orelse i>255 then raise Chr else [i]
    exception Ord
    fun ord nil = raise Ord | ord (i::r) = i
    fun ordof(s,i) = nth s handle Nth => raise Ord
    fun print s = (output(std_out,s); s)
  end
\end{verbatim}
\section{Pervasives}
\begin{verbatim}
signature PERVASIVES =
  sig
    structure Ref : REF
    structure List : LIST
    structure Array : ARRAY
    structure ByteArray : BYTEARRAY
    structure IO : IO
    structure Bool : BOOL
    structure String : STRING
    structure Integer : INTEGER
    structure Real : REAL
    structure General : GENERAL
  end
\end{verbatim}
A module \verb"Pervasives", matching this signature, is defined.  The
initial environment contains this structure, which has been
recursively ``\verb"open"ed,'' so that (for example) \verb"nil" may
be referred to as \verb"nil", \verb"List.nil", or
\verb"Pervasives.List.nil".

\section{Extensions}
\begin{verbatim}
signature Extensions =
  sig
        val use : string -> unit
        val exportML : string -> bool
        val exportFn : string * (string list * string list -> unit) -> unit
        val exn_name : exn -> string
  end
\end{verbatim}
The extensions to the standard may vary from implementation to
implementation.  These are a suggested few.
\begin{description}
\item[\verb"use"]  Given a name of a file, \verb"use" compiles
and executes its contents as if they were typed into the top-level
prompt of the interactive system.  \verb"use" may be nested
recursively.

\item[\verb"exportML"]  Creates an executable file whose name is
given by the argument.  When this file is executed, it is an ML
system in exactly the same state as the one that wrote the file.  For
example, the command
\verb|(exportML "foo"; print "Hello");| writes a file that, when
executed, prints \verb"Hello" and then returns to the top-level
prompt.  exportML returns true when the executable file is run,
and false when simply returning.

\item[\verb"exportFn"]  Creates an executable file whose name is given
by the first argument.  When this file is executed, it is an ML
system that calls the function given as the second argument, then
exits.  The ML system created will not have a compiler or a
top-level, so it will be significantly more compact.
The command-line arguments and environment
are passed as the string list arguments to the
function that is called.   \verb"exportFn" may terminate
execution of the ML system that called it.

\item[\verb"exn\_name"]   Given an exception value as an argument,
returns the name of the exception constructor used to create it.
\end{description}
