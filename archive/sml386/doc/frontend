The only changes in the front end are:

1. Structure names of toplevel structures are shortened because DOS only
   allows 8 character file names.

2. Filenames are shortened to 8 characters.

3. Most editors for the PC uses both LF and CR (0A and 0D) for
   newline. Therefore the scanner has been changed to include the CR in
   the white spaces ( ws=("\012"|"\013"...)*; )
