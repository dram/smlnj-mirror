Standard ML of New Jersey (SML\_NJ) is a Standard ML compiler suitable
for porting to different architectures. The compiler consists of a
front end written i ML, a back end also written in ML, and a runtime
system written i C and assembler. The front end is relatively
independent of the target machine. This makes it easy to port the
system to other architectures.

SML\_NJ has up to now been reserved for workstations running UNIX.
Code generators are available for a number of processors and the
runtime system has been adapted to different UNIX versions.

The purpose of this paper is to report a new code generator for the
Intel 80386 processor and a revised runtime system which runs under
Windows. The code generator described in this paper is almost
independent of the runtime system and consequently of the operating
system, so it can be used in other architectures based on the 80386
processor, such as OS/2 and XENIX.
