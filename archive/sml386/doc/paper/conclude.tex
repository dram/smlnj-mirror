\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

We have succeded in porting the SML\_NJ version 0.66 to a PC running
Windows. A general 80386 code generator is made, which can be used in
other architectures based on the 80386 processor. The new runtime
system lacks some of the facilities found in the UNIX version, but we
will not continue working on the runtime system until new 32-bit
versions of Windows and C compilers becomes available. The purpose of
this project was to see if it was possible to implement the whole
SML\_NJ system on a PC, and that we have proved.

No changes have been made in the front end\footnote{We had to change
some structure names because filenames in DOS can only be upto 8
characters in length.}, so the whole system is implemented. Other
compilers for a subset of ML are available on the PC, but this is the
first time (to our knowledge) that a complete SML compiler runs on the
PC.
