Other changes
-------------

The Windows 95/NT version is now distributed as an InstallShield(tm)
package (110-smlnj.exe).  This is a self-extracting archive. You execute
it, it unpacks, and starts up the setup program by itself. From that point,
it's pretty standard installation procedure common on Windows. The only
thing maybe to note is that a reboot is strongly advised, to have the
changes to the registry (PATH env. variable and such) take effect. Note
that the archive does not contain the source code, except for the SML/NJ
Library, which is provided in source, and the ml-yacc library. If one
wants the source of ml-lex, ml-yacc, ml-burg, the runtime, the compiler,
or CM, you have to download the appropriate compressed tar file.
