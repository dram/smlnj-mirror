			Standard ML of New Jersey
	     Version 110, Patch 7 (110.0.7), September 28, 2000
	     --------------------------------------------------

This is Version 110.0.7 of Standard ML of New Jersey, also known as Version 110,
Patch 7.  The primary purpose of this patch version is to fix a bug in the
implementation of signals that caused problems in CML, but a number of other
bug fixes are included, as well as some enhancements.  Specifically, the SML/NJ
Library has had a number of additions.  For details of changes, improvements,
and bug fixes for this and previous 110 patch versions, read the 110-PATCH-HISTORY
file.

Version 110 implements the SML '97 definition, including the new Basis
library, with a few minor omissions and discrepancies that are
documented in the SML '97 Conversion Guide available at:

  http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj/doc/Conversion/index.html

Version 110 has been thoroughly tested and we believe it to be fairly
free of serious bugs and instabilities.  As usual, the bug lists are
available at:

  ftp://ftp.research.bell-labs.com/dist/smlnj/working/bugs

We strongly urge that those who are still using SML/NJ 0.93 and those
who have been using intermediate working versions should move to
Version 110.

The Version 110 distribution includes:
  * the interactive SML/NJ compiler itself
  * CM - an itegrated compilation manager supporting separate
	compilation, automatic dependency analysis, autoloading
  * The Standard ML of New Jersey Library (smlnj-lib)
  * CML - Concurrent ML
  * eXene - an elegant interface to X11 (based on CML)
  * SMLNJ-C library for interfacing to C code
  * Visible Compiler facilities for access to compiler internals
  * A programming toolset: ML-Lex, ML-Yacc, ML-Burg, execution profiler

Systems Supported
-----------------
SML/NJ 110 has been tested on these machine/OS combinations:

   Sparc:  Solaris 5.5.1 through Solaris 8
   Alpha:  Digital Unix 4.0
   MIPS (R10000):  IRIX 6.5
   IA-32 (Pentium):  Solaris 8, Linux, FreeBSD 3.2, Win98, WinNT, Win2000
   HPPA: HPUX 10.1

The IBM RS6000/AIX[3.2, 4.1] platform should also be supported, but we
no longer have such a machine to test on.  The system may also run
under Sparc/SunOS 4.x and MIPS/IRIX 5.x,6.[2-4], but hasn't been
tested on those platforms.  Please let us know if you can successfully
install on a configuration not listed above.

We recommend running SML/NJ on machines with at least 32MB of physical
ram, which will be adaquate for small projects and classroom exercises.
As usual, larger projects will run better with more ram.

There is a performance issue that may affect users running on machines
with small swap spaces.  Because of new optimizations performed by the
compiler and a conservative strategy for allocating virtual memory in
the runtime system, Version 110 can require significantly more
_virtual_ memory than was used by 0.93, particularly during
compilation of large source files, while at the same time using less
_physical_ memory than 0.93.  This means that if you have a small swap
space allocated on your machine, you may need to increase the
allocation in order to compile or run some large programs.  A future
version of the runtime system will implement a tighter allocation
scheme that will reduce virtual memory usage.

Documentation
-------------
The documentation for Version 110 is available at our web site

  http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj

including nearly final documentation of the SML '97 Basis library and
an SML '97 Conversion Guide that describes language changes but is
still "under construction" at the moment.  Work is continuing to improve
the content and organization of the documentation, so suggestions are
welcome.

Distribution Files
------------------
The Version 110 distribution files are available at

  ftp://ftp.research.bell-labs.com/dist/smlnj/release/110/

with mirror sites:

  ftp://rodin.stanford.edu/pub/smlnj/release/110/
  ftp://flint.cs.yale.edu/pub/smlnj/release/110/
  ftp://ftp.diku.dk/pub/smlnj/release/110/

  ftp://ftp.ntua.gr/pub/lang/smlnj/release/110/
  ftp://compiler.kaist.ac.kr/pub/sml/release/110/

The distribution consists of the following files (most of the files
are in Unix compressed tar format, indicated by the ".tar.Z" suffix).

  NOTE: with this patch release, we have dropped the "110-" prefix on the
  source and binary tarballs making up the distribution.  This brings the
  release practice in line with recent working versions.

For manual installation, you will need at least the config.tar.Z,
runtime.tar.Z, the bin.* files for the machines on which you
intend to install the software, and the source files for the
components (CM, ML-Lex, ML-Yacc, CML, eXene) that you want installed
(these are defined in the config/targets file).  The file smlnj.exe
can be used to automatically install SML/NJ on Windows 95 and NT, and
the rpm package RPMS/smlnj-110.0.7-0.i386.rpm can be used to install
under Linux (tested under Red Hat Linux 6.1).
