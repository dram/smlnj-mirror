This file describes the latest release of the Standard ML of New
Jersey compiler.  The main changes relative to previous versions are
described in the file doc/NEWS.

We are eager to receive your bug reports, comments, and constructive
criticism.  The documentation is still in a primitive state, but your
comments on the installation instructions and manual would be
appreciated.  Any error message beginning with "Compiler bug"
definitely indicates a bug in the compiler and should be reported.
Please use an appropriate variation on the bug reporting form in the
file doc/bug.form and send comments and bug reports to:

Instructions for installing the compiler are in the file doc/INSTALL.

The primary means of distributing the compiler is anonymous internet
ftp from hosts princeton.edu (ftp directory pub/ml) and
research.att.com (ftp directory dist/ml).  For those who do not have
internet access directly or indirectory, distribution by tape is
possible as a last resort.

FTP distribution

To obtain the compiler by internet ftp, connect to host princeton.edu
use login id "anonymous" with your name as password, and go to directory
pub/ml ("cd pub/ml").  Then put ftp in binary mode ("binary") and "get"
the relevant files in that directory.  An alternate site is research.att.com,
directory "dist/ml".

Host:		 Net Address:	Login:	    Passwd:	  Directory:
princeton.edu	 128.112.128.1	anonymous   Your address  pub/ml
research.att.com 192.20.225.2	anonymous   Your name	  dist/ml

The directory pub/ml (dist/ml on research.att.com) contains a
file named README that describes the current release and the following
compressed tar files:

  66.doc.tar.Z       : the doc directory containing documentation
  66.src.tar.Z       : the src directory containing source code
  66.lib.tar.Z       : the lib directory containing contributed software
  66.mo.m68.tar.Z    : the mo.m68 directory of m68 object files
  66.mo.vax.tar.Z    : the mo.vax directory of vax object files
  66.mo.sparc.tar.Z  : the mo.sparc directory of sparc object files
  66.mo.mipsl.tar.Z  : MIPS Little-endian object files (for DEC machines)
  66.mo.mipsb.tar.Z  : MIPS Big-endian object files (for MIPS machines)

You need only transfer the mo.*.tar.Z files that you need for your
machines (e.g. mo.m68.tar.Z for Sun 3, NeXT, etc., mo.vax.tar.Z for
Vax).  

***************************************************************************
NOTE: Ftp should be put into binary mode before transferring the compressed
tar files.
***************************************************************************

Here is a sample dialog:

   ftp
   ftp> open princeton.edu
   Name: anonymous
   Password: <your name@host>
   ftp> binary
   ftp> cd pub/ml
   ftp> get README
   ftp> get 66.src.tar.Z
   ftp> get 66.lib.tar.Z
   ftp> get 66.doc.tar.Z
   ftp> get 66.mo.m68.tar.Z
   ftp> get 66.mo.vax.tar.Z
   ftp> close
   ftp> quit

After the files are transferred they should be uncompressed using the
uncompress command and then extracted using tar into a directory
called mldist.  It may not be necessary to transfer all the files; if
you do not intend to run the compiler on a Vax, for instance, there is
no need to get the mo.vax.tar.Z file.

For example:

   mkdir mldist
   mv 66.src.tar.Z mldist
   cd mldist
   uncompress -c 66.src.tar.Z | tar xf -

will unpack the src directory.

2. Description of files in the distribution

README (this file) contains some general information on the distribution.

The mo.vax, mo.m68, and mo.sparc directories contain the Vax, Motorola
MC68020, and SPARC object files for the compiler.  The mo.mipsl and
mo.mipsb contain Little-endian and Big-endian MIPS object files for
the compiler.  (The National Semiconductor 32000 is not currently
supported, but might be again in the future.)

The src directory contains the source code of the compiler.

lib contains contributed software.  At the moment, this consists of
a lexical analizer generator (lib/lexgen), a parser generator
(lib/mlyacc), a code generator generator (lib/mltwig), and a gnu emacs
major editing mode (lib/emacs), and the sourcegroup separate compilation
system.

The doc directory contains a number of documentation files for installing and
using the compiler:

  INSTALL 	directions for installing the interactive Standard ML system.

  BATCHINSTALL	directions for using the interim batch system and bootstrapping
		the compiler.

  NEWS		general information on changes and new features.  A number of
		important features of the compiler are documented only in this
		file, alas.

  users		a mailing list of current site contacts.  Please inform us of
		any updates or corrections.

  help		hints for beginners on using the system.

  differences	a (partial, out of date) list of differences between Standard
		ML of New Jersey and the Edinburgh compiler.

  weak-types	a very brief explanation of weak type variables.

  callcc	an explanation of the new callcc primitives.

  profiling	an explanation of how to use the profiling facilities.

  optimize	hints on making your programs run faster

  localspec	comments on "local" specifications in signatures

  bugs		current list of known bugs (please check this before submitting
		bug reports).

  masterbugs    list of all bugs ever reported (most of which are fixed).

  bug.form	suggested format for bug reports.

  refman/	LaTeX sources for an incomplete, provisional reference manual.

  examples/	A collection of example programs.  We would like to collect 
		additional examples contributed by users.  Please mail your
		example programs to macqueen@research.att.com.

  man/		Manual pages for various system-building tools, and for sml.
		These can be printed with "troff -man".

  papers/	source files (troff -ms, TeX, or LaTeX) for papers describing 
		the compiler.
