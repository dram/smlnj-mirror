\begin{abstract}
This manual is a major revision by Andrew W. Appel and David B. MacQueen
of the {\em Standard ML} reference manual (ECS-LFCS-86-2).  That
document is divided into three parts: the Core language description
by Robin Milner, the standard I/O library by Robert W. Harper,
and the Module system by David B. MacQueen.  This new manual reflects
a slightly evolved language, and describes the library functions
(initial environment) built into the Standard ML of New Jersey system,
developed at AT\&T Bell Laboratories and Princeton University.

At present the manual is in a very rough form, and should be
considered a preliminary draft.  This version is distributed
primarily as documentation of the mid-1989 distribution of the
{\it Standard ML of New Jersey} compiler.
