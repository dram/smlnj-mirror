This is a sample parser for Standard ML.  The grammar contains a few bugs,
so this almost parses Standard ML (known bug: the portion of the grammar
for the types of tuples, try test/arrayext.sml to see this bug).

To construct it, first use ML-Yacc on the file "ml.grm" to construct
the files "ml.grm.sig" and "ml.grm.sml".  This can be done by loading
ML-Yacc and typing "ParseGen.parseGen "ml.grm".  Then construct the
lexer by using ML_Lex on the file ml.lex ("LexGen.lexGen "ml.lex"").

Finally, load the background file "base.sml".  Then use "load.sml" to
load all the files.  Some sample ML programs with syntax errors are in the
directory test.
