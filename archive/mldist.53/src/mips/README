This is a working, but unfinished, implementation for the MIPS architecture.
The source files are the ".nw" files, which are a mixture of TeX and
ML in the spirit of Knuth's Tangle/Weave programs.  The TeX file describing
the implementation (produced from all the .nw files) may be found in
the doc/mips directory.
