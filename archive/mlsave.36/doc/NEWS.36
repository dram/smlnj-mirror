Standard ML of New Jersey version 0.36, 4 July 1989

Release notes by Andrew Appel.

Changes since version 0.33:

1.  Support for Sun-4 (SPARC) thanks to John Reppy at Cornell;
    Encore (NS32032), NeXT (also Mach on other 68020 machines), and 
    Sony NEWS (68020-based workstation), thanks to James O'Toole at MIT.

2.  An interpreter for faster compilation (4x) but slower execution (18x).
    Set System.Control.interp := true to enable this mode.  Use the -i
    or -ionly to makeml to set this option as the default.

3.  Delay and Force primitives (meant for internal use only) for research
    in lazy evaluation.

4.  Bug fixes:   reading 2049-byte files works now.  Separate compilation
    shouldn't dump core.  Miscellaneous others.

5.  A code generator generator implemented by Johan Lilius,
    Jari Porra, & Jussi Rintanen of Helsinki University of Technology 
    is include in the Standard ML Software Library: see src/lib/twig.

6.  Various internal efficiency improvements; the CMACHINE signature was
    simplified a bit; the format of generational-gc update lists was changed;
    the CPS optimizer was beefed up.

Forthcoming in future releases:

- Mach support for Vax and other machines.

- Macintosh (native operating system) and Intel-386 ports are under development
at the University of Pennsylvania.

- Our MIPS code generator seems to work now (thanks to Norman Ramsey at
Princeton ), but we are having problems with the operating system on the
DECstation 3100.  We hope to release a version of SML-NJ for the DECstation in
August 1989.

- Our next release will contain an improved version of ML-Yacc by David
Tarditi at Princeton, more efficient and with a better interface.

- We are continuing to make progress on the debugger, which may be ready late
in 1989.
