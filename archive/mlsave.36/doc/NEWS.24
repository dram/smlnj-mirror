New features of SML of NJ Version 0.24 (November 22, 1989)

1. Profiler

A call-count and statistical profiler has been implemented.  See
operating instructions in the README file, and the paper provided in
src/doc/papers/profiling.


2. Runtime reorganization

The runtime system has been reorganized to reduce the need for assembly
language and provide a standard interface for Unix system calls and
C code.  It should become possible to add special purpose C code to
the runtime system, for instance to provide an X windows interface.
Many of the assembly language functions have been replaced by more
portible C implementations and uses of the system call interface.
See src/doc/VERSION.24 for some more details.


3. Memory Management tuning

The variable

  System.Control.Runtime.ratio : int ref

can be used to control the garbage collection behavior to some extent,
in conjunction with the Unix limit variable (in the csh).  See the
discussion in README.


4. Simple gnu emacs sml mode

A simple gnu emacs sml mode was contributed by Mitch Wand.  It can be
found in src/lib/sml.el.  If you have a better mode or make improvements
on this version, please send them in to macqueen@research.att.com for
inclusion in future releases.
