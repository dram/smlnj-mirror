\chapter{Introduction}

This is a preliminary draft of the 1988 Standard ML manual.  It is a
revision of the Milner/Harper/MacQueen Edinburgh technical report,
taking account of changes to the language definition in the last year
or two.

The document at present has quite a few gaps.  It should be treated
as a guide to the 1987 pre-release, rather than as a complete
reference manual.
