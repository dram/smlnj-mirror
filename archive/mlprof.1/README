This is the first profiling test run.  Purelinked closures
have just been implemented.  KNOWN strings and reals and CONST's
are still copied into closures.  Both profiling compilers produced
identical code (mo.flat).  Results are in prof.1.
Why are the number of closures, strings, and records of length 2 different?
I don't know; the compilers seem functionally identically, were run
on the same source, and produced the same object files.
This is a version of the compiler somewhere between mlsave.13 and mlsave.14.
