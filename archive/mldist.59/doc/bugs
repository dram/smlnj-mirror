4. duplicate specifications not checked
Problem:
  No checking for duplicated specifications in signatures.
Version: 0.18
Comment:
  This should be done when building the signature symbol table.

86. incorrectly allows redefining of "="
Submitter: Dave Berry
Date: 3/15/89
Version: 0.29
Problem:
    NJML handles the = symbol incorrectly in some cases.

    - val op = = op = ;
    - nonfix =;
    - = (true, true);
    Error: declaration or expression expected, found EQUAL
Comment:
    The = symbol may not be redefined (Definition, page 4).  The top definition
    does seem to redefine =, despite the lack of response from the system.
    I can't see anything in the Definition that forbids making = nonfix,
    so I suppose it should be possible to use it in a nonfix way.

139.  compiling with gcc doesn't work 
Submitter: Brian Boutel, brian@comp.vuw.ac.nz
Date: 9 November 1989
Version: 0.36 & later
System: HP/Sun 3
Problem: compiling with gcc doesn't work 
Description:

    I have been trying again to port sml to H-P 68030 boxes running
    MORE/bsd, using the Gnu C  compiler. 

    We have a mix of Sun3 and H-P machines, and, although I have installed
    sml on the suns, it would be convenient to have it available on the H-Ps as well.

    The H-P port has not worked, and to separate the problems arising from
    the Operating System from those arising from the use of gcc, I have
    tried building sml on the suns with gcc (using the -traditional
    option). The build completes, but the resulting sml dies immediately
    while doing a major garbage collection. It does not get as far as
    announcing itself as Standard ML of .....
    I have tried various options, (optimiser on/off some of the gcc -f
    options) without effect. Have you tried gcc? I am anxious to persue
    this as  I think getting a gcc compiled version to run on the suns is
    the right first step towards porting to the H-Ps. Can you offer any suggestions?

    I am using sml version 0.36.  ( I tried today to ftp to
    research.att.com to check for a later version, but found an empty
    directory when logging on as anonymous, and was refused permission to
    log on as mldist.)


    Changes made to the source are summarised as

    ------
    gnu C compiler requires f68881 to be changed to m68881
    Changed in makeml by introducing $CCOMP, set to GNUCC for machine hp300,
    otherwise "", and testing it in defining CFL for M68

    ----------------
    for H-P, sys/exec.h defines MID_HP300 instead of M_68020
    linkdata.c and export.c have conditional code if HP300 defined
    makeml has to pass HP300 to make for linkdata
    -------------
    for H-P, callgc.c has FPE_TRAPV_TRAP undefined, and
    TRAPV returns FPE_INTOVF_TRAP
    so FPE_TRAPV_TRAP is defined as FPE_INTOVF_TRAP in callgc.c
    ----------
    _minitfp_ and _fp_state_mc68881 not defined anywhere for H-P
    .globl omitted if HP300 in M68.prim.s
    --------------------
    run dies because stack clobbered by apply
    Registers saved ala NeXT/MACH in saveregs/restoreregs in prim.s if GNUCC
Comment: (appel) gcc works on some machines

185. exportML size
Submitter: Soren Christensen,
           University of Aarhus, Computer Science Dep.,
           Denmark
           schristensen@daimi.dk
Date:      24 jan 90
Version:   0.44
System:    Sun4/280 / SunOS 4.0.1
Severity:  ???
Problem:
Ussualy I have build my application by declaring a number of structures,
this could be done using less than 45Mb of heapspace, even if I set the
the flags like:

 System.Control.CG.reducemore := 0;
 System.Control.CG.rounds := 10;
 System.Control.CG.bodysize := 20;

The system produced from an "exportML" of this takes up app. 3Mb.

>From "doc/optimize" I learned that the code could be optimized by
enclosing it in one structure. I did like:

structure whole :
  sig
   < ... >
  end =
struct
 <The usual stuff ..>
end;
open whole;

It meant that the heapsize had to be increased to 80 Mb and I had to reset
the above flags.

I observed a bug in the reporting of GC:
...
[Major collection... 76% used (18670576/24426980), 34260 msec]

[Increasing heap to 59632k]

[Major collection... -57% used (25033788/31118476), 44190 msec]

[Increasing heap to 68216k]

[Major collection... -35% used (30575468/34993364), 54880 msec]
...

The "-57%" should be "80%" and the "-35%" should be "87%".

But the main problem  is that the CG before the "exportML" only decreases
the heap to 49Mb, and then it stops with the message "export" - due to no
disk space (?)

Comments: (appel)  Setting these flags for optimization may cause the
code generator to generate very large output.  Use at your own risk.

219. parsing layered patterns
Submitter: Andrew Appel
Date: 5/90
Version: 0.56 and later
Severity: minor
Problem: parsing of layered pattern is too liberal.  An atomic pattern is
  accepted where a variable is required by the Definition syntax.
Code:
  let val (x) as (y :: z) = [1,2] in x end
Comments:
  Seems to require nontrivial change to the mlyacc grammar
