New features of SML of NJ Version 0.22 (October 10, 1988)

This file describes the most notable changes since version 0.20.  (Version 0.21
was a local version that was not distributed.)


1. Bugs

A few bugs have been fixed; exportFn works again; the system runs under the
latest version (4.0) of Sun Unix on a Sun-3.  See src/doc/bugs for the
remaining known bugs.  The next release with many more bug fixes will
probably follow fairly shortly.


2. Sharable text segments

We now have an option to run sml with the compiler read-only and sharable
(in the Unix text segment).  This should help on systems where several
people are running sml at once, and also improves garbage-collector performance.
See src/doc/INSTALL for more info.


3. CPS code generator

We are including the source code for the new cps code generator with
this release for those who would like an early look at it.  This code
generator is still under development and works only on Vaxes at this
point.


4. Installation

The maker script for building the interactive image has been reorganized
and new scripts maker.batch and maker.run have been added to simplify
making batch systems and compiling the runtime system.  See src/doc/INSTALL
and src/doc/BATCHINSTALL for details.


5. Lexer generator

The directory src/lib is a new directory for contributed software.
The programs included here do not come under the terms of the AT&T
license.  The first contributed software is a lexical analyzer
generator similar to the Unix lex utility.  It is in src/lib/lexgen.
lexgen has been used to generate a new lexical analyzer for the
compiler.  The specification is in src/lex/ml.lex.
