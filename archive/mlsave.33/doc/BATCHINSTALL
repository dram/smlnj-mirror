Standard ML of New Jersey's Batch Compiler


Description:

The Standard ML of New Jersey batch compiler provides some (unsafe)
separate compilation and cross compilation capabilities.  The batch system
compiles files containing signature, structure, and functor declarations,
i.e. only module level declarations are allowed.  Compiling a module "Foo"
produces a corresponding object file "Foo.mo", which contains the names of
the other .mo files required to build the module, as well as the code of
the module itself.  Modules are compiled separately, producing the
necessary .mo files.

A program is executed by passing a module name to the run-time system
[see the summary of the program runtime/run in doc/INSTALL].  The
run-time system starts a linker which loads in the module, finds out
what other modules it depends on, recursively loads them and passes
them to the original module.  The module then "builds" itself, by
executing its top-level declarations and creating a run-time
structure.  For example, the following module will build a run-time
record containing foo, and as a side effect of building the record,
"hello world" will be printed:

	structure HelloWorld =
	  struct
	    val foo = print "hello world"
	  end

Thus programs will take the form of the collection of all modules on
which the given top-level structure (transitively) depends.  The order
in which the modules will be executed/created is determined by a
postorder traversal of the (acyclic) dependence graph.

Using the batch system for separate compilation is unsafe since the
.mo files contain no type information, only the names of the modules
on which they directly depend.  However, as long as each module has
the correct signature, the run-time record will be type-correct; in
other words, it is safe to edit, re-compile, and re-link modules as long
their signatures do not change.


Installation:

The compiler is composed of two parts: a run-time system written in C and
assembly language; and a number of ML object files which form the main part
of the compiler.  The run-time system provides garbage collection, signal
handling, and system calls; the rest of the compiler, including the
standard library, is written in ML.  The .mo files for the compiler
reside in the mo.vax and mo.m68 subdirectories of the ML distribution.
The source for the compiler resides in the src subdirectory, and these
instructions assume that this the current directory.

To build a batch compiler:

1. Go to the src subdirectory of mldist:

     cd src

2. Run the maker.batch script:

     maker.batch machine os sharemode

   The parameters of the maker.batch shell script have the same meaning and
   options as for the interactive system.  See src/doc/INSTALL.

   As the command executes, you should see messages like "[Loading Foo]" and
   "[Executing Bar]", which indicate the modules being linked in, and then
   messages like "signature ASSEMBLY" and "functor CoreFunc", which
   indicate that the standard library is being compiled.
   
   When the command successfully terminates, an executable image named
   "batch" has been created in the current directory.  This is the batch
   ML compiler.  If you wish to use a different name for this file, edit
   the "maker.batch" script and change the definition of the variable
   IMAGE.

   Now you can run the batch compiler by typing "batch".  You can give it
   commands interactively, or by redirecting its input from a file, as is
   done below with the command script "all".


Normally you will want to build a complete interactive or batch
system, but there are occasions when you may want to build just the
runtime system.  There is a shell script maker.run for doing this:

1. Go to the src subdirectory of mldist:

     cd src

2. Run the maker.run script:

     maker.run machine os sharemode

   The parameters of the maker.run shell script have the same meaning and
   options as for maker and maker.batch.  When this script successfully
   terminates, an executable image runtime/run will have been created.

When invoked, runtime/run takes the name of a module (say "Foo") as a
parameter.  It looks for a file with path name mo/Foo.mo relative to
the current directory and loads that file, and then recursively loads
mo/Bar.mo for all modules Bar on which Foo depends.  Finally the code
for creating the module Foo is executed.  For instance, to run the
interactive system on a Vax, one could symbolically link mo to
mldist/mo.vax (or ../mo.vax if current directory is src) and execute 
the command

   runtime/run IntVax

This causes mo/IntVax.mo to be loaded, together with all the modules
on which it depends (essentially the whole compiler).  IntVax.mo
(defined in src/build/glue.sml) causes the interactive top-level loop
to be executed when the functor Interactive is applied.  Any program can
be directly loaded and executed by the runtime system in this manner,
not just the compiler.

The runtime system accepts the option flags -h, -r, -m, and -g to
control heap sizing and garbage collection messages.  These are
described in doc/INSTALL.


Using the batch compiler:

The batch compiler accepts commands on its standard input.  The list of
commands is:

     !file      => compile the file.
     *file      => assemble the file.
     <file      => parse the file.
     >file      => export to a file.
     %          => print the last generated lambda (intermediate code).
     #word      => comment; ignored.
     @directory => look for files in a directory.  directory should end in /.
     ~function  => execute a function.
     ^flag      => toggle a flag.
     ?          => print this help message.

There should be no space between the command character and the
argument string, which should not be quoted.

The execute ("~") and toggle ("^") commands are mainly used to control
debugging facilities, which are not explained here.  Typing "^" alone
on a line produces a list of possible flags.

The compile command, "!", causes the named file to be compiled,
generating an object file A.mo for each module A defined in the file.
The assemble command, "*", generates an assembly listing A.s that can
be assembled to produce the corresponding .mo file.  The parse
command, "<", causes the file to be parsed and type-checked, but
produces no output files.  These three commands all update the symbol
table with the bindings defined in the file.  The file must contain
only signature, structure, and functor declarations.

The export command ">" exports the current state of the batch compiler
to an executable file with the given name.  This is a way of
preserving the symbol table state of the compiler, and is useful for
separate compilation; if you change a module without changing its
signature, you can safely recompile it using the exported compiler
(which contains the symbol table information from other modules that
the modified module may require).  For example, the file "all" in the
src directory is a batch command script for compiling the compiler.
The last command in the file exports to a file "upto.all", which can
recompile any module of the compiler.

Once you have compiled all of your code, you only need to move it to the
mo directory and execute it in the same way as CompM68 or CompVax:

  runtime/run Foo

for a module Foo.  Note that the files CoreFunc.mo, Math.mo (for Vax),
Initial.mo, and Loader.mo must be in the mo directory, as they are
used in bootstrapping the system.


A note on recompiling the compiler:

NOTE: Recompiling the compiler will require a heap size of at least
6MB, so it if possible it should be done on a machine with at least
8MB of physical memory.  Use the -m flag of runtime/run to set softmax
as high as reasonable (e.g. -m 6000 on an 8MB Sun 3).

NOTE: Beware of using the sharable runtime system when recompiling the
compiler, since it has the effect of embedding old versions of the .mo
files into the system.  Either use a nonsharable version of
runtime/run, or rebuild a sharable runtime/run after each iteration
of compiling the compiler to incorporate the latest .mo files.

If you change the compiler, you can use the batch command script "all"
to recompile it with the batch system:

	batch < all

or	runtime/run {CompM68 | CompVax} < all	

This will generate new .mo files for all the modules in the compiler including
the "boot" modules (whose source files are found in src/boot):

  CoreFunc.mo  [boot/core.sml]
  Math.mo (used by Vax only) [boot/math.sml]
  Initial.mo  [boot/perv.sml]
  Loader.mo   [boot/loader.sml]

These are generated by the "~mBoot" command in the all script rather
than using the "!" compile command.  These files are treated
differently because of their role in bootstraping the pervasive (or
built-in) environment.

The newly generated .mo files should be moved into a new mo directory,
say mldist/mo.new:

	cd ..   (to mldist)
	mkdir mo.new
	mv src/*.mo mo.new

After generating new .mo files for the compiler (including the boot
modules if necessary), you should build a new batch compiler by
symbolically linking mldist/mo.new to mldist/src/mo and recompiling
the source code again by invoking runtime/run directly:

	cd src
	ln -s ../mo.new mo
	runtime/run {CompM68 | CompVax} < all	

(maker.batch can't be used here, since it would relink src/mo to one of
the standard mo directories).  The resulting .mo files should be
identical to the previous set of .mo files in mo.new.  Sometimes more
than one iteration is necessary (for example if the signature of one
of the boot modules has changed).  The bootstrapping is successful
when two successive iterations produce identical .mo files.

The last command in the all file causes an image of the batch compiler
to be saved in the file upto.all.  This image contains the symbol
table information for all the modules in the compiler.  It can be used
to recompile individual files in the compiler after they have been
modified (but beware of changes in signatures).
