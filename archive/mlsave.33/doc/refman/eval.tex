\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{eval}
\section{Environments and Values}
Evaluation of phrases takes place in the presence of an {\em environment} and a
{\em store}.  An {\em value environment} E maps identifiers to values, value constructors, and
exception constructors.  A {\em store} S maps references to values; references
are themselves values.  (Type environments TE, are
ignored here since they are relevant only to
type-checking and compilation, not to evaluation.  Other environments
having to do with the module system are also ignored here.)

A value $v$ is either a constant (a nullary constructor), a
construction (a constructor applied to a value), a record, a
reference, or a function value.  A record value is a set of
label-value pairs, written \{ label = value , \rep{0} , label = value \},
in which the labels are distinct; note that the order of components
is immaterial.  Labels may be identifiers or integer numerals; both
kinds of labels may appear in the same record value.  A function
value is a partial function which, given a value, may return a
value or may raise an exception; it may also change the store as a side-effect.

An exception $e$, associated to an exception name  {\em exn} in a value
environment, is a special kind of constructor.  Exception
constructors may be nullary or value-carrying, just as may ordinary
constructors.  Nullary exception constructors, and constructed
exceptions (exception constructors applied to values), are ordinary
values of type {\em exn}.

Evaluation of a phrase returns a {\em result}---a value $v$,
a value-environment $E$, or a store $S$ as follows:

\begin{tabular}{l l}
{\bf \ \ Phrase}&{\bf \  Value} \\
Expression & v and S, or raise(v) and S\\
Value binding & E and S, or raise(v) and S\\
Type binding & {\it no effect on E or S} \\
Datatype binding & E \\
Exception binding & E \\
Declaration & E and S, or raise(v) and S
\end{tabular}

The remainder of this chapter describes the semantics of various
phrases in terms of the values $v$ and 

The semantics of stores ($S$) is discussed in
Chapter~\ref{reference};
for the remainder of this chapter, the
effect of various phrases on stores will be ignored.
The semantics of exceptions is discussed in
Chapter~\ref{exception}; 


For every phrase except a \verb"handle" expression, whenever its
evaluation demands the evaluation of an immediate subphrase which
returns a raised exception {\em raise(v)} as a result, no further
evaluation of subphrases occurs and {\em raise(v)} is also the result
of the phrase.  This rule should be remembered while reading the
evaluation rules below.

In presenting the rules, explicit type
constraints (:ty) have been ignored since they have no effect on
evaluation.

\section{Environment manipulation}
We may write $\{ i_1 \mapsto v_1 , ... , i_n \mapsto v_n \}$ for a
value environment E (the identifiers $i_k$ being distinct).  Then
$E(i_k)$ denotes $v_k$, $\{\}$ is the empty value environment, and
$E+E'$ means the environment in which the associations of $E'$
supersede those of $E$.

\section{Matching patterns}
Patterns serve in ML both as formal parameters of functions, and
as indices in case statements.  When a function or a case statement
is applied to a particular value, one of its patterns may match the
value.

A nullary constructor (like \verb"nil") used as a pattern
will match only the corresponding nullary constructor value.  A
value-carrying constructor $c$, applied to a pattern $p_1$, makes a pattern
$c(p_1)$;
this constructed pattern will match a value $c(v_1)$
built with the same value-carrying constructor, and only if the
pattern $p_1$ matches the value $v_1$.

A record pattern 
\verb"\{" ${\rm lab}_1$ \verb"=" ${\rm pat}_1$ , \underline{\ \ \ } , ${\rm lab}_n$ \verb"=" ${\rm pat}_n$ \verb"\}"
matches a record value whose labels are the same, and only if each
pattern matches the corresponding value.
If the ellipsis (\verb"...") is used at the end of a record pattern,
then it will match a record value with {\it at least} the labels
specified in the pattern.

An identifier (i.e. a variable)
used as a pattern will match any value; when this happens, the
variable will also be bound to that value throughout the variable's
scope.  When a variable is a component of a record or constructor
pattern, then it is bound to a particular component of the record
value or constructed value.

An underscore will match any value.

Sometimes it is desired to bind a variable to a value only
if the value matches a particular pattern.  The pattern 
{\it id}\verb" as "{\it pat} binds the value to the variable {\it
id}, but only if the {\it pat} matches.

Type constraints may be applied to patterns.  {\it pat\verb":"ty}
matches the same values that {\it pat} does, but the compiler will
guarantee that the pattern will only be applied to values  of type
{\it ty}.

\subsection*{A more formal description}
The matching of a pattern to a value $v$ either {\em fails} or yields
a value environment.  Failure is distinct from raising an exception,
but an exception will be raised when all patterns fail in applying a
match to a value (see Sections~\ref{raisematch}, \ref{raisebind}, and \ref{reraise}).  In the following rules, if any
component pattern fails to match then the whole pattern fails to
match.

The following is the effect of matching a pattern  to a value $v$ in the
environment $E$, for
each of the kinds of pattern (with failure if any condition is not
satisfied):
\begin{description}
\item[\protect\verb"\_"\hfill]  {\it (underscore)} the empty value environment $\{\}$ is
returned
\item[id\hfill] if $E(id)$ is not a constructor, then the value environment
$\{id \mapsto v\}$ is returned
\item[id\hfill] if $E(id)$ is a nullary constructor, then if $E(id)=v$,
then $\{\}$ is returned, else failure
\item[id pat\hfill]  if $E(id)$ is a value-carrying constructor $c$, and 
$v = c v'$, then pat is matched to $v'$, else failure.
\item[id \protect\verb"as" pat\hfill]  pat is matched to $v$ returning $E$;
then $\{id \mapsto v\}+E$ is returned.
\item[\protect\verb"\{" ${\rm lab}_1$ \protect\verb"=" ${\rm pat}_1$ , \underline{\ \ \ } , ${\rm lab}_n$ \protect\verb"=" ${\rm pat}_n$ \protect\verb"\}" \hfill]  
if $v = \{ {\rm lab}_1 = v_1 , ... , {\rm lab}_n = v_n \}$ then 
${\rm pat}_i$ is matched to $v_i$ returning $E_i$, for each $i$; then 
$E_1 + ... + E_n$ is returned.

\item[\protect\verb"\{" ${\rm lab}_1$ \protect\verb"=" ${\rm pat}_1$ , \underline{\ \ \ } , ${\rm lab}_n$ \protect\verb"=" ${\rm pat}_n$ \protect\verb", ... \}" \hfill]  
if $v = \{ {\rm lab}'_1 = v_1 , ... , {\rm lab}'_m = v_m \}$ then if
the ${\rm lab}_i$ are a subset of the ${\rm lab}'_j$ then
${\rm pat}_i$ is matched to $v_j$ returning $E_i$, for each $i,j$ such that
${\rm lab}_i = {\rm lab}'_j$; then 
$E_1 + ... + E_n$ is returned.
\end{description}
No pattern may contain the same variable twice.
No record pattern, record expression, or record type may use the same
label twice.
\section{Applying a match}
Assume environment $E$.  Applying a match
$ {\rm pat}_1 \protect\verb"=>" {\rm exp}_1 \mid ... 
\mid {\rm pat}_n \protect\verb"=>" {\rm exp}_n $ to value $v$ returns a value
or raises an exception as follows.  Each ${\rm pat}_i$ is matched to
$v$ in turn, from left to right, until one succeeds returning $E_i$;
then ${\rm exp}_i$ is evaluated in $E+E_i$.  If none succeeds, then
an exception is raised, depending on the syntactic context in which
the match occurs (see Sections~\ref{raisematch}, \ref{raisebind}, and \ref{reraise}).
\label{matchwarn}
If a match contains a redundant pattern (where any value that could
satisfy it will be matched by a previous pattern in the match), the
compiler will issue a warning message.  If the match (except those
that form exception-handlers) is not exhaustive (some value matches
none of the patterns) then the compiler will issue a warning message.

Thus, for each $E$, a match denotes a function value.

\section{Evaluation of expressions}
Evaluating an expression in the environment $E$ returns a value (or raises an
exception) as follows, in each of the cases for exp:
\begin{description}
\item[id\hfill]  the value $E(id)$ is returned; id may be a variable-id or a
constructor-id
\item[const\hfill]  the value denoted by the constant (an integer, real, or
string literal) is returned.
\item[${\bf exp}_1 {\bf exp}_2$\hfill] ${\bf exp}_1$ is evaluated, 
returning function $f$; then ${\rm exp}_2$
is evaluated, returning value $v$; then $f(v)$ is returned.
\item[\protect\verb"\{" ${\rm lab}_1$ \protect\verb"=" ${\rm exp}_1$ , \underline{\ \ \ } , ${\rm lab}_n$ \protect\verb"=" ${\rm exp}_n$ \protect\verb"\}" \hfill]  
the ${\rm exp}_i$ are evaluated in sequence, from left to right,
returning $v_i$ respectively; then the record 
$\{ {\rm lab}_1 = v_1 , ... , {\rm lab}_n = v_n \}$ is returned.
\item[\protect\verb"raise" exp\hfill]  exp is evaluated, returning $v$; then 
the exception-value $v$ is raised.

\item[exp \verb"handle" match\hfill]  exp is evaluated; if exp returns a
value $v$, then $v$ is returned.  If exp raises an exception $e$ then
the match is applied to $e$.  If the match fails, then $e$ is raised
(as the value of the \verb"handle" expression).  If the match
succeeds, then the resulting value is returned.

\item[\verb"let" dec \verb"in" exp \verb"end"\hfill]  dec is evaluated,
returning $E'$; then exp is evaluated in the environment $E+E'$.

\item[\verb"fn" match\hfill]  $f$ is returned, where $f$ is the function of
$v$ gained by applying match to $v$ in the environment $E$, and such
that if the match fails, an exception \verb"Match" will be raised.
\label{raisematch}
But matches that may fail are to be detected by the
compiler and flagged with a warning; see Section~\ref{matchwarn}.
\end{description}

\section{Evaluation of value bindings}
Evaluating a value binding in environment $E$ returns a value
environment $E'$  or raises an exception as follows:
\begin{description}
\item[pat \verb"=" exp\hfill]  exp is evaluated in $E$, returning value
$v$; then pat is matched to $v$; if this returns $E'$ then $E'$ is
returned.  If the pattern fails to match then the exception 
\verb"Bind" will be raised.
\label{raisebind}
But bindings that may fail are to be detected by the
compiler and flagged with a warning; see Section~\ref{bindwarn}.

\item[${\bf vb}_1$ \verb"and" \underline{\ \ \ } \verb"and" ${\bf vb}_n$\hfill]
The value bindings ${\bf vb}_1$ through ${\bf vb}_n$ are evaluated in
$E$ from left to right, returning $E_1 , ... E_n$; then $E_1 + ... +
E_n$ is returned.

\item[\verb"rec" vb\hfill]  {\bf vb} is evaluated in $E'$, returning $E''$,
where $E' = E + E''$.  Because the values bound by \verb"rec" {\bf
vb} must be function values, $E'$ is well defined by ``tying knots''
(Landin).
\end{description}
No binding may bind the same identifier twice.

\label{bindwarn}
For each value binding ``pat = exp'' the compiler will issue a
warning message if {\rm either} pat is not exhaustive {\rm or} pat
contains no variable.  This will (on both counts) detect a mistaken
declaration like \verb"val nil = f(x)" in which the user expects to
declare a new variable nil (whereas the language dictates that
\verb"nil" here is a constant pattern, so no variable gets declared).
However, these warnings need not be given at top level in the
interactive system.
\section{Evaluation of type and datatype bindings}
The value environment $E$ does not affect the evaluation of type
bindings or datatype bindings ($TE$ affects their type-checking and
compilation).  Evaluation of a type binding just returns the empty
value environment $\{\}$; the purpose of type bindings is merely to
provide an abbreviation for a compound type.

Evaluation of a
datatype binding {\bf db} returns a value environment $E'$ (it cannot
raise an exception) as follows:

\begin{description}
\item[tyvars id = ${\bf constr}_1 \mid \underline{\ \ \ } \mid {\bf constr}_n$\hfill]
New constructors ${\bf con}_1, ... , {\bf con}_n$ are created.
The value environment $E' = \{ id_1 \mapsto v_1 , ... , id_n \mapsto
v_n \} $ is returned, where $v_i$ is either the constant value
${\bf con}_i$ (if ${\bf constr}_i$ is just ${\bf id}_i$), or else the
function which maps $x$ to ${\bf con}_i(x)$ (if ${\bf constr}_i$ is
${\bf id}_i$ \verb"of" {\bf ty}).

\item[${\bf db}_1$ \verb"and" \underline{\ \ \ } \verb"and" ${\bf db}_n$\hfill]
The bindings ${\bf db}_1 , ... , {\bf db}_n$
are evaluated from left to right, returning $E_1 , ... , E_n$; then
$E_1 + ... + E_n$ is returned.
\end{description}
In the left hand side ``tyvars id'' of a type of datatype binding,
no type-variable may appear twice in ``tyvars.''
The right hand side may contain only the type variables
mentioned on the left.  Within the scope of the declaration of
``id,'' any occurrence of the type constructor ``id'' must be
accompanied by as many type arguments as indicated by the (possibly empty)
tyvar sequence ``tyvars'' in the declaration.

No binding may bind the same identifier twice.
\section{Evaluation of exception bindings}
The evaluation of an exception binding in an environment $E$ returns an
environment $E'$ as follows:
\begin{description}
\item[id\hfill]   A new exception constructor {\bf con} is generated, and
the environment $\{{\bf id} \mapsto {\bf con} \}$ is returned.

\item[id \verb"of" ty \hfill]  A new exception constructor {\bf con} is generated,
and the environment $\{{\bf id} \mapsto v\}$ is returned, where $v$ is the
function of $x$ that returns ${\bf con}(x)$.

\item[${\bf id}_1$ \verb"=" ${\bf id}_2$ \hfill]  The environment
$\{ {\bf id}_1 \mapsto E({\bf id}_2) \}$ is returned; that is, 
${\bf id}_1$ is bound to the same exception constructor as ${\bf id}_2$.

\item[${\bf eb}_1$ \verb"and" \underline{\ \ \ } \verb"and" ${\bf eb}_n$\hfill]
The bindings ${\bf eb}_1 , ... , {\bf eb}_n$
are evaluated from left to right, returning $E_1 , ... , E_n$; then
$E_1 + ... + E_n$ is returned.
\end{description}
No binding may bind the same identifier twice.
\section{Evaluation of declarations}

Evaluating a declaration in a value environment $E$ returns a value
environment $E'$ or raises an exception as follows (as usual in this chapter,
the effect on type environments is ignored):

\begin{description}
\item[\verb"val" vb\hfill] The value binding {\rm vb} is evaluated,
returning $E'$; then $E'$ is returned.

\item[\verb"type" tb\hfill] The empty environment $\{\}$ is returned.

\item[\verb"datatype" db\hfill]  {\rm db} is evaluated, returning
$E'$, which is returned.

\item[\verb"exception" eb\hfill]  {\rm eb} is evaluated, returning
$E'$, which is returned.

\item[\verb"local" ${\bf dec}_1$ \verb"in" ${\bf dec}_2$ \verb"end"\hfill]
${\rm dec}_1$ is evaluated in $E$, returning $E_1$; then 
${\rm dec}_2$ is evaluated in $E+E_1$, returning $E_2$; then $E+E_2$
is returned.

\item[${\bf dec}_1$ ${\bf dec}_2$\hfill]
${\rm dec}_1$ is evaluated in $E$, returning $E_1$; then 
${\rm dec}_2$ is evaluated in $E+E_1$, returning $E_2$; then $E_1+E_2$
is returned.

\item[${\bf dec}$ \verb";"\hfill] has the same effect as {\bf dec}.
\end{description}
\section{Evaluation of a program}
The evaluation of a program ${\bf dec}_1$ \verb";" \underline{\ \ \ }
\verb";" ${\bf dec}_n$ takes place in the initial presence of the
standard top-level environment $E_0$ containing all the standard
bindings (see Appendix~\ref{library}).  For $i>0$ the top-level environment
$E_i$, present after the evaluation of ${\bf dec}_i$ in the program,
is defined recursively as follows:  ${\bf dec}_i$ is evaluated in
$E_{i-1}$ returning environment ${E'}_i$, and then $E_i =
E_{i-1}+{E'}_i$.
