\begin{abstract}
This manual is a major revision by Andrew W. Appel
of the {\em Standard ML} reference manual (ECS-LFCS-86-2).  That
document is divided into three parts: the Core language description
by Robin Milner, the standard I/O library by Robert W. Harper,
and the Module system by David B. MacQueen.

I have attempted to integrate the three parts, add more detail to the
description of the standard library, bring the documentation
up to date with the recent changes to the language ({\em e.g.}
exceptions), more clearly explain the semantics ({\em e.g.}
references), etc.

At present the manual is in a very rough form, and should be
considered a preliminary draft.  This version is distributed
primarily as documentation of the February 1988 distribution of the
{\it Standard ML of New Jersey} compiler.
