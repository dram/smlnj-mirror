Sample form for reporting bugs in SML of NJ

This is a suggested form for submitting bug reports; feel free to alter it
to suit your needs, but try to include the essential information (e.g. it
is not always convenient or appropriate to separate code and compiler messages).
Bug reports are most useful if you can narrow down the cause of the bug
to as small a fragment of code as possible.  Also, please check src/doc/bugs
to see if your bug is already known.  Suggestions on how to improve the compiler
are also welcome, even if they don't identify a specific bug.  Examples of
unhelpful error messages are also useful.
