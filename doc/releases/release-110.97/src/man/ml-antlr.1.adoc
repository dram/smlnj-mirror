NAME
----
ml-antlr - an LL(k) parser generator for Standard ML

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ml-antlr* ['OPTIONS'] 'file'

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*ML-Antlr* is an LL(k) parser generator for Standard ML that is loosely modeled
on Terence Parr's *ANTLR* parser generator.

OPTIONS
-------

*-32*::
  run the 32-bit version of the program (currently the default).

*-64*::
  run the 64-bit version of the program.  This option only applies to
  the **x86-64** (aka **amd64**) architecture.

*--dot*::
  generate DOT output (http://www.graphviz.org[]).  The generated file will be named +file.dot+,
  where +file+ is the input file.

*--latex*::
  generate a simple LaTeX version of the grammar, named +file.tex+.

*--unit-actions*::
  ignore the action code in the grammar, and instead return +unit+ for every production.
