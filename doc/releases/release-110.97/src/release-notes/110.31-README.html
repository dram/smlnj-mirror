 <h4>Intel x86 floating point </h4>
   As of 110.31, there is an alternative floating point code generator
   and register allocator for the x86.  Since this is still experimental,
   by default this is turned off.  To turn this on, do:
 
<pre>
     CM.autoload "$smlnj/compiler.cm";
     Compiler.Control.MLRISC.getFlag "x86-fast-fp" := true;
</pre>

   The new floating point code generator treats the x86 fp stack as
   7 registers, plus one temporary, and directly allocates floating point
   values into these registers.  
   Currently, fp parameter passing is still
   done through memory, so the new code generator only benefits floating
   point heavy loops.  However, code compiled under the old and new 
   code generator can coexist. The algorithm is described in

   this paper</a>.

    We compared Version 110.30 compiling the PCLubIN entry in the
    ICFP'00 programming context. 

<pre>

     By inlining Array2 in the same benchmark we get the following results:

     Results from other benchmarks:
<pre>
     barnes-hut            1.714     1.696        1.0%   
     fft                   0.954     0.906        5.2%
     mandelbrot            19.91     14.99       32.8%
     matrix-multiply(a)    47.77     45.81        4.3%
     matrix-multiply(b)    17.04     15.42       10.5%
     simple                 3.02      2.69       12.3%
     tsp                    1.75      1.656       5.6%
</pre>
	NOTE: Matrix multiply(b) has all bounds checking removed.

     Each test is run 10 times and I take the average.

     Overall, the numbers do not improve as much as I was hoping, except for
     mandelbrot.  The following benchmarks compare smlnj with mlton and C:

<pre>
		     mandelbrot fft    barnes-hut 
     sml/nj 110.30   19.91      0.96   1.71       
     sml/nj new fp   14.99      0.90   1.71       
     gcc -O          14.83      
     gcc -O6         14.01      0.68
     mlton -O6       17.46      1.04   1.62       
     (version 200000906) 
</pre>

 <h4>Internal <tt> regmap</tt> Changes </h4>
<ol>
<p><li> Changed interface to <tt>CELLS</tt> and the type of <tt>cell</tt>, <tt>cellkind</tt>, <tt>cellset</tt> etc. 

<p><li> No more regmaps!!  The attributes of cells, including its current color,  
      are accessible from <tt>CELLS</tt> interface.  Cells can now take arbitrary 
      annotations.  [They will also have a width attribute in the next 
      go around.]

<p><li> Interface of <tt>STREAM</tt> etc have changed (again, no more regmap).

<p><li> Some MLTREE constructors, like <tt>IF</tt>, <tt>BCC</tt>, <tt>JMP</tt>, <tt>CALL</tt>, etc have 
      been simplified.  <tt>CVTI2I</tt> has been renamed into <tt>SX</tt> and <tt>ZX</tt> respectively,
      following the lambda rtl convention.

<p><li> The old RA interface was getting too complicated.  There are now
      two functors, <tt>RISC_RA</tt> (in ra/risc_ra.sml) and <tt>X86RA</tt> (in x86/ra/x86RA.sml)
      which abstract out from all the ugly business.  The first is for
      RISC machines, and the second is for x86.  Please let us know if you
      use these functors.

<p><li> The cell change broke the peephole phases, because they used to
      pattern match on specific cell number.  I (Allen) hacked up a simple 
      tool to translate fake SML with where clauses into real ML.  This makes 
      it much easier to write the rules.  Seems to work. (See Tools/WhereGen)
