  	This working version is believed to be stable, but
	we have not run our full regression-test suite.

<dt>Summary:
<dd>A number of small, but important bug fixes.</dd>
</dl>

<hr>

<h3>Details:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in <tt>MatchTree.nth</tt> (regexp library).
<li>Fixed a long-standing memory leak in the GC where a program
	with fixed-sized live data could suffer from unbounded VM
	growth (bugs 1119 and 1131).  Note that we thought that this
	bug was fixed in 110.40, but we were wrong.
<li>Fixed inlined versions of <tt>Real.min</tt> and <tt>Real.max</tt>.
<li>Resurrected <tt>SMLofNJ.Internals.BTrace.mode</tt>, which had gone missing.
<li>Added missing implementation of <tt>IEEEReal.fromString</tt>.
<li>Added missing implementations of
    <tt>OS.Path.</tt>{<tt>from</tt>,<tt>to</tt>}<tt>UnixPath</tt>.
<li>Exported structure <tt>BTImp</tt> from
	<tt>$smlnj/viscomp/debugprof.cm</tt> so that other clients can
	set up backtracing support.
</ul>
