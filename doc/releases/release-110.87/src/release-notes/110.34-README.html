<h3>Summary:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A long-standing signal-handling bug has been fixed.</li>
  <li>As a result, CML finally works again, and so does eXene.</li>
  <li>NLFFI has been further revised and improved.  It now supports   the
Sparc architecture in addition to x86/Linux.</li>
  <li>There are various bugfixes and some organizational changes.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<div align="Left">
<hr width="100%" size="2" align="Left">
<h4>NLFFI:   </h4>
<ul>
  <li>The types in the public interface to the "C" module have been     simplified:
the annoying 'f type parameter has been dropped in     most places.  This
requires some cheating under the hood, but     fortunately the cheat is a
provably safe cheat.</li>
  <li>Various bugs in ml-nlffigen have been fixed so that it should be  
  more robust now.</li>
  <li>C functions and function types that use variable-length argument  
  lists are no longer rejected.  Instead, ml-nlffigen will produce     ML
code that lets you call the function with just its mandatory     arguments.
 This means that ml-nlffigen will not bail out just     because there is
one odd occurence of a varargs function somewhere     in one big .h-file.</li>
  <li>Default names for files are now derived from the C files's basename 
    so that ml-nlffigen will always place them in the current directory.</li>
  <li>Default names for generated ML identifiers are also derived from  
  the C file's basename.</li>
  <li>Sparc architecture supported now.</li>
  <li>Support for x86/win32 mostly in place.  (All missing pieces are   
 in the runtime system.)  </li>
</ul>
<h4>CM:   </h4>
<ul>
  <li>CM can now generate "index files" which are human-readable     files
that list on a per-.cm-file basis each toplevel symbol     defined or imported.</li>
  <li>some internal improvements in the tools subsystem</li>
  <li>"lambdasplit" parameter for class "sml" to control the cross-module 
    inliner documented</li>
  <li>other documentation updates</li>
  <li>bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<h4>runtime:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A serious signal handling problem that affected CML has been fixed.</li>
  <li>Support for dlopen/dlsym on Sparc/Solaris added. </li>
</ul>
<h4>CML:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Compiles under the new CM.</li>
  <li>Libraries and anchors for version 110.34 and later are organized  
  as follows:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><b>$cml/cml.cm</b>            : Main CML library.</li>
    <li><b>$cml/basis.cm</b>          : CML's version of $/basis.cm.</li>
    <li><b>$cml/cml-internal.cm</b>   : Internal helper library.</li>
    <li><b>$cml/core-cml.cm</b>       : Internal helper library.</li>
    <li><b>$cml-lib/trace-cml.cm</b>  : Tracing facility.</li>
    <li><b>$cml-lib/smlnj-lib.cm</b>  : CML's version of $/smlnj-lib.cm  </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h4>eXene:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Compiles under the new CM.</li>
  <li>The library's name for version 110.34 is <b>$/eXene.cm</b>.  </li>
</ul>
<h4>scripts:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The config/install.sh script has been updated to support the installation 
    of CML and eXene under the New World Order (aka new CM). </li>
</ul>
<h4>compiler:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>bug fixes</li>
  <li>cross-module inliner now in the compilation pipeline by default   
 <i>(By default it is still turned off. But it can be enabled either    
 globally or selectively by using CM's new "lambdasplit" parameter.)</i>  
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>MLRISC:   </h4>
<ul>
  <li>Sparc implementation of c-calls API.  (This is used by NLFFI.)    
    <i>(Caveat: Register assignments in the Sparc backend of SML/NJ     
still need to be redone.  In particular, the ASM temp register      must
not be %o2.  It is unlikely but not impossible that the      current situation
leads to certain subtle code-generation bugs.)</i> </li>
  <li>Support for "stdcall" calling convention in x86 version of c-calls. 
 </li>
</ul>
<h4>CKIT:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>structure Error exported from ckit-lib.cm </li>
</ul>
