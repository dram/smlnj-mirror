== Summary

This i a patch release that includes a few bug fixes and which enables
running **SML/NJ** on **M1** (aka **Arm**) Macs under
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/about-the-rosetta-translation-environment[Rosetta2].
Because the system is running under emulation, it may not be as reliable
as when running as a native application on a *AMD64* processor.  We are
working on a native *Arm64* port that we hope to release this summer.

== Details

=== Runtime System

Modified the stack frame layout on **AMD64** to better support the **LLVM**
backend (currently under development).

=== SML/NJ Library

The `ListMergeSort.sort` function is now stable (as claimed by the documantation).

Added some additional mechanism to the `JSONUtil` structure to make
writing robust queries easier.

=== Installation

It is possible to install the *amd64* version of the system on *M1* Macs.
Because these machines run Big Sur, you will need to control-click on the
installer package and open it with the installer application.

=== 32-bit macOS issues

While the {dist-dir}smlnj-x86-{version}.pkg[x86 installer]
for {version} works on **macOs** 10.14 Mojave, building from source
requires some extra steps because the version of **Xcode**
distributed for Mojave does not include a 32-bit SDK.

Another issue that you may encounter
when building on **macOs** 10.14 Mojave is an error message for a shell
script of the form

.....
  /bin/sh: bad interpreter: Operation not permitted
.....

This error arises because the `com.apple.quarantine` attribute is set on the
shell script.  To fix the problem, remove the attribute using the command

[source,shell]
-----
  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine shell-script
-----
and resume the build.

== Bugs
