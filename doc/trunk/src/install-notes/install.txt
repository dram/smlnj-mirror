== Introduction
These instructions are for installing Standard ML of New Jersey
(**SML/NJ**) on **Unix** and Unix-like operating systems (including
**Cygwin**, **Linux**, and **macOS**) from source and the pre-compiled
bin files.

To install **SML/NJ** on **macOS** using the installer package, see
the {dist-dir}macos.html[**macOS** installation instructions].

To install **SML/NJ** on **Windows**, see the
{dist-dir}windows.html[**Windows** installation instructions].

== Preparing for installation

== Installing 32-bit SML/NJ

Currently, the default installation of SML/NJ is for 32-bit machines.

== Installing 64-bit SML/NJ

As of version 110.94, SML/NJ supports 64-bit installations on some
systems (currently **Linux** and **macOS**).

[source,shell]
--------------
% config/install.sh -default 64
--------------

== Installing both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of SML/NJ

It is possible to install both versions in the same location by running
the `install.sh` script twice.  For example, the commands

[source,shell]
--------------
% config/install.sh -32
% config/install.sh -default 64
--------------

will install both versions with the 64-bit version as default.  One
can then use the command **sml -32** to run the 32-bit version of
the system.  Note that the default version must be installed second.
