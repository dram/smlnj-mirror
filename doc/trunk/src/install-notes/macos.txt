== Introduction
These instructions are for installing Standard ML of New Jersey
(**SML/NJ**) on **macOS**.

== Using the installer package

The most direct way to install **SML/NJ** is to use one of the
provided installer packages:
--
  * {dist-dir}smlnj-x86-{version}.pkg[[.tt]#smlnj-x86-{version}.pkg#] (32-bits)

  * {dist-dir}smlnj-amd64-{version}.pkg[[.tt]#smlnj-amd64-{version}.pkg#] (64-bits)
--

There is also a https://brew.sh[Homebrew] cask that wraps the 64-bit installation
package.  If you have homebrew installed, then you can run the following command
to install **SML/NJ**:

[source,shell]
--------------
% brew cask install smlnj
--------------

If you have previously installed **SML/NJ** using Homebrew, then you will
need to use the command

[source,shell]
--------------
% brew cask upgrade smlnj
--------------

== Installing from source

It is also possible to install **SML/NJ** from source code and the pre-compiled
bin files.  To do so, you will need a copy of Apple's **Xcode** development
environment.  Furthermore, you will need to install the command-line tools,
which you can do by running the command

[source,shell]
--------------
% xcode-select --install
--------------

With the command-line tools installed, you can follow the standard
{dist-dir}install.html[instructions] for installing on **Unix/Linux**
systems.

[NOTE]
=========
For **macOS** 10.13 High Sierra and earlier, the default install is 32-bits.
Starting with **macOS** 10.14 Mojave, the default install is 64 bits.
It is possible to install **SML/NJ** on Mojave, but it requires some
extra steps (see the instructions below).
=========

== Installing 32-bit SML/NJ on macOS 10.14 (Mojave)

**Xcode** 10.1 (and later) does not include the libraries needed to
build 32-bit executables, such as the **SML/NJ** runtime.

To support building on Mojave, there is a special makefile (`mk.x86-darwin18`)
for the runtime system and the `config/install.sh` uses this makefile
when necessary.  This makefile expects that the `MacOSX10.13.sdk` directory
from **Xcode** 9 has been
copied into the **Xcode** 10 `SDKs` directory.  Note that updating **Xcode**
from the AppStore will remove the 10.13 SDK, so you should keep
a copy in a safe place.

The **Xcode** SDKs live in `Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs`
under the `Developer` directory.  One can determine the path to the
current developer directory using the command

[source,shell]
--------------
% xcode-select -p
--------------

== Quarantine issues

Another issue that you may encounter when building from source
on **macOs** 10.14 Mojave is an error message for a shell
script of the form

.....
  /bin/sh: bad interpreter: Operation not permitted
.....

This error arises because the shell script has the `com.apple.quarantine`
attribute set.  To fix the problem, remove the attribute using the command

[source,shell]
-----
% xattr -d com.apple.quarantine shell-script
-----

and resume the build.
