== Introduction
These instructions are for installing Standard ML of New Jersey
(**SML/NJ**) in the https://cygwin.com[**Cygwin**] 32-bit environment.

=== Building SML/NJ as a Unix application

It is recommended that you install SML/NJ in a volume that has
been mounted in https://www.cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/using-textbinary.html[**binmode**].

Otherwise, just following the standard {dist-dir}install.html[instructions]
for installing on **Unix/Linux** systems.

=== Building SML/NJ as a Windows application

It is possible to build **SML/NJ** using the Windows version of
the runtime system under **Cygwin**.  To do so, you must set the
`SMLNJ_WINDOWS_RUNTIME` shell variable:

[source,shell]
--------------
% export SMLNJ_WINDOWS_RUNTIME
% SMLNJ_WINDOWS_RUNTIME=1
% config/install.sh
--------------
