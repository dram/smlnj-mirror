NAME
----
smlnj - an implementation of the Standard ML language with supporting tools and libraries.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Compiled programs in the SML/NJ system are represented using a pair of the
runtime system executable and a _heap image_ file.  Heap images have a filename
suffix that is based on the architecture and operating system.
