NAME
----
ml-ulex - a Unicode-compatible lexical analyser generator

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ml-ulex* ['OPTIONS'] 'FILE'

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Ml-ulex is a lexer generator.

OPTIONS
-------

*--dot*::
  generate DOT output (http://www.graphviz.org[]).  The generated file will be named +file.dot+,
  where +file+ is the input file.

*--match*::
  enter interactive matching mode.  This will allow interactive testing of the machine; presently, only the \texttt{INITIAL} start state is available for testing
  (see Section~\ref{sec:start-states} for details on start states).

*--ml-lex-mode*::
  operate in *ml-lex* compatibility mode.  See Section~\ref{sec:lex-compat} for details.

*--table-based*::
  generate a table-based lexer.

*--fn-based*::
  generate a lexer that represents states as functions and transitions as tail calls.

*--minimize*::
  generate a minimal machine.  Note that this is slow, and is almost never necessary.

*--strict-sml*::
  generate strict SML (_i.e._, do not use SML/NJ extensions).  This flag
  is useful if you want to use the output with a different SML system.
