NAME
----
ml-makedepend - makefile dependency generator for SML/NJ programs

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ml-makedepend* ['OPTIONS'] 'project.cm' 'target'

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Ml-makedepend is a tool for generating dependency information to allow the
Unix *make*(1) program to be used to build SML/NJ programs.

OPTIONS
-------
*-f* 'makefile'::
  Specify the name of the makefile to which the dependency information is appended.  If this
  option is _not_ given, then the output is appended to the end of the file +makefile+
  (or +Makefile+).  It is an error if neither file exists and the *-f* option is not specified.

*-a* 'arch'::
  specifies the name a make variable for architecture-specific filenames and paths
  (the default is +ARCH+).

*-o* 'os'::
  specifies the name a make variable for operating-system-specific filenames and paths
  (the default is +OPSYS+).

*-n*::
  generates full filenames and paths with any architecture or operating-system-specific
  parts expanded out to their definition for the host system.  If this option is specified,
  then any *-a* and *-o* options are ignored.

*-C*'control'::

*-D*'name'::

*-U*'name'::
