NAME
----
ml-nlffigen - foreign function glue-code generator for Standard ML

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ml-nlffigen* ['OPTIONS'] 'file'

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*ML-Nlffigen* is a tool for generating glue code from **C** language
header files.  The generator reads **C** source code and emits *SML*
code along with a description file for the compilation manager (CM).

OPTIONS
-------

*-dir, -d* 'dir'::
  output directory where all generated files are placed (default `NLFFI-Generated`).

*-allSU*::
  instructs *ml-nlffigen* to include all structs and unions,
  even those that are defined in included files, as opposed
  to files explicitly listed as arguments.

*-width* 'w'::
  set output line width (just a guess) to 'w' (default `75`).

*-smloption* 'flg'::
  instructs *ml-nlffigen* to add 'flg' to the list
  of options to annotate `.sml` entries in the generated `.cm`
  file with.  By default, the list consists just of "`noguid`."

*-guid*::
  Removes the default "noguid" from the list of sml options.
  This option re-enables strict handling of type- and object-identity
  but can have negative impact on CM cutoff recompilation
  performance if the programmer routinely removes the entire
  tree of ml-nlffigen-generated files during development.

*-target, -t* 'tgt'::
  Sets the target to 'tgt' (which must be one of "sparc-unix",
  "x86-unix", or "x86-win32").  The default is the host architecture.

*-light, -l*::
  suppress "heavy" versions of function wrappers and
  field accessors; also cancels any earlier *-heavy* option.

*-heavy*::
  suppress "light" versions of function wrappers and
  field accessors; also cancels any earlier *-light* option.

*-namedargs, -na*::
  instructs *ml-nlffigen* to generated function wrappers that
  use named arguments (*SML* records) instead of tuples if
  there is enough information for this in the **C** source.

*-nocollect*::
  Do not collect enum constants from truly unnamed enumerations
  (those without tags that occur at toplevel or in an unnamed
  context; __i.e.__, not in a typedef or another named struct
  or union) into a single artificial enumeration tagged by `'`
  (single apostrohe).  The corresponding SML-side representative
  will be a structure named `E_'`.

*-enum-constructors, -ec*::
  When possible (i.e., if all values of a given enumeration
  are different from each other), make the ML representation
  type of the enumeration a datatype.  The default (and
  fallback) is to make that type the same as MLRep.Signed.int.

*-libhandle, -lh* 'h'::
  Use the variable 'h' to refer to the handle to the
  shared library object.  Given the constraints of CM, the argument 'h'
  must have the form of a long ML identifier; __e.g.__,
  `MyLibrary.libhandle` (default `Library.libh`).

*-include, -add* 'file'::
  Include 'file' in the generated `.cm` file.  This option
  is necessary at least once for providing the library handle.
  It can be used arbitrarily many times, resulting in more
  than one such programmer-supplied file to be mentioned.
  If 'file' is a relative path, then it must be relative to
  the directory specified in the *-dir* option.

*-cmfile, -cm* 'file'::
  Specifies the name of the generated `.cm` file, relative to the directory
  specified by the *-dir* option (default `nlffi-generated.cm`).

*-cppopt* 'opt'::
  The string 'opt' gets added to the list of options to be
  passed to the *C* preprocessor.  The list of options
  gets substituted for `%o` in the cpp command line template.

*-U*'x'::
  The option (__i.e.__, *-U*'x') is added to the list of cpp options.

*-D*'x'::
  The option (__i.e.__, *-D*'x') is added to the list of cpp options.

*-I*'x'::
  The option (__i.e.__, *-I*'x') is added to the list of cpp options.

*-version*::
  Print the version number of *ml-nlffigen* to standard output and then quit.

*-match, -m* 'r'::
  Normally *ml-nlffigen* will include ML definitions for a *C*
  declaration if the *C* declaration textually appears in
  one of the files specified at the command line.  Definitions
  in included files will normally not appear (unless
  their absence would lead to inconsistencies).
  By specifying *-match* 'r', *ml-nlffigen* will also include
  definitions that occur in recursively included files
  for which the AWK-style regular expression 'r' matches
  their names.

*-prefix, -p* 'p'::
  Generated *SML* structure names will all have the prefix 'p'
  (in addition to the usual "`S_`" or "`U_`" or "`F_`").

*-gensym, -g* 'g'::
  Names generated by *ml-nlffigen* (for anonymous struct/union/enums)
  will get `_`'g' as an additional suffix.  This option should
  be used if output from several indepdendent runs of
  *ml-nlffigen* are to coexist in the same ML program.

*--*::
  Terminate processing of options, remaining arguments are
  taken to be **C** sources.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------
*ML-Nlffigen* looks at the environment variable `FFIGEN_CPP` to obtain
the template string for the *C*-Preprocessor command line.  If `FFIGEN_CPP` is not
set, the template defaults to "`gcc -E -U__GNUC__ %o %s > %t`."
The actual command line is obtained by substituting occurences of
`%s` with the name of the source, and `%t` with the name of a temporary
file holding the pre-processed code.
