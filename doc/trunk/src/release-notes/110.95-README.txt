== Summary

This release fixes a few critical problems with 110.94, as well as a
couple of other bugs.  There are no new features or other major changes.

== Details

=== Installation

==== 64-bit support

The various installation and configuration scripts have been updated
to accept a command-line argument to override the
default machine size when running on the x86/amd64 architecture.
For the `config/install.sh` script, you can specify the machine-word
size of the target architecture as follows:

--
  **-default** __size__::
    specify the default size for the **sml** and other commands, where
    __size__ is either **32** or **64**.

  **-32**::
    install the 32-bit version of the system.

  **-64**::
    install the 64-bit version of the system.
--

It is possible to install both versions in the same location by running
the `install.sh` script twice.  For example, the commands

[source,shell]
--------------
  % config/install.sh -32
  % config/install.sh -default 64
--------------

will install both versions with the 64-bit version as default.  One
would then use the command **sml -32** to run the 32-bit version of
the system.

If both versions are installed, then use the **-32** or **-64** flag
to override the default version.

==== 32-bit macOS issues

While the {dist-dir}smlnj-x86-{version}.pkg[x86 installer]
for {version} works on **macOs** 10.14 Mojave, building from source
requires some extra steps because the version of **Xcode**
distributed for Mojave does not include a 32-bit SDK.

Another issue that you may encounter
when building on **macOs** 10.14 Mojave is an error message for a shell
script of the form

.....
  /bin/sh: bad interpreter: Operation not permitted
.....

This error arises because the `com.apple.quarantine` attribute is set on the
shell script.  To fix the problem, remove the attribute using the command

[source,shell]
-----
  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine shell-script
-----
and resume the build.

=== Runtime System

The runtime now uses `MAP_ANON` for allocating memory on 64-bit Linux.
This change fixes a problem with versions of Linux that do not allow
access to `/dev/zero`.

== Bugs

Here is a list of tracked bugs fixed (or closed) with this release, please see the

The following unnumbered bugs were also fixed:
--
  * Fixed the AST pretty printer so that it handles datatype replication
    declarations.

  * Fixed problem with 64-bit runtime on some versions of Linux (*e.g.*.
    Linux on ChromeBooks).

tested some of them:
