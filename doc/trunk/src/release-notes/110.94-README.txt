== Summary

This release fixes a critical bug in the Windows implementation.

== Details

=== Installation

While the {dist-dir}smlnj-x86-{version}.pkg[installer]
for {version} works on macOS 10.14 Mojave, building from source
requires some extra steps.  Another issue that you may encounter
when building on macOS 10.14 Mojave is an error message for a shell
script of the form

.....
  /bin/sh: bad interpreter: Operation not permitted
.....

This error arises because the `com.apple.quarantine` attribute is set on the
shell script.  To fix the problem, remove the attribute using the command

[source,shell]
-----
  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine shell-script
-----
and resume the build.


=== Compiler

=== MLRISC

Fixed a number of bugs in the instruction selection and encoding for the
**AMD64** architecture.  Also made a slight improvement to the **X86**
instruction selector.

=== Runtime System

== Bugs

Here is a list of tracked bugs fixed (or closed) with this release, please see the

tested some of them:

=== A note about 64-bit support

Apple is in the process of deprecating 32-bit support in macOS.
With macOS 10.14 Mojave, compiling 32-bit applications, such as the SML/NJ
runtime system, requires using an older SDK.
The SML/NJ {dist-dir}smlnj-x86-{version}.pkg[installer],
however, works without issue on macOS 10.14 Mojave.

We have been working on 64-bit support since 110.81 we expect to have it in place
before the release of macOS 10.15.
