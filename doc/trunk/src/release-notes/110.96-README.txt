== Summary

This release fixes a couple of scripting bugs related to supporting both
32 and 64-bit versions of the system, as well as some other 64-bit-related
issues.  It also adds 64-bit support for **FreeBSD**.

== Details

=== Installation

==== 64-bit support

The various installation and configuration scripts have been updated
to accept a command-line argument to override the
default machine size when running on the x86/amd64 architecture.
For the `config/install.sh` script, you can specify the machine-word
size of the target architecture as follows:

--
  **-default** __size__::
    specify the default size for the **sml** and other commands, where
    __size__ is either **32** or **64**.

  **-32**::
    install the 32-bit version of the system.

  **-64**::
    install the 64-bit version of the system.
--

It is possible to install both versions in the same location by running
the `install.sh` script twice.  For example, the commands

[source,shell]
--------------
  % config/install.sh -32
  % config/install.sh -default 64
--------------

will install both versions with the 64-bit version as default.  One
would then use the command **sml -32** to run the 32-bit version of
the system.

If both versions are installed, then use the **-32** or **-64** flag
to override the default version.

==== 32-bit macOS issues

While the {dist-dir}smlnj-x86-{version}.pkg[x86 installer]
for {version} works on **macOs** 10.14 Mojave, building from source
requires some extra steps because the version of **Xcode**
distributed for Mojave does not include a 32-bit SDK.

Another issue that you may encounter
when building on **macOs** 10.14 Mojave is an error message for a shell
script of the form

.....
  /bin/sh: bad interpreter: Operation not permitted
.....

This error arises because the `com.apple.quarantine` attribute is set on the
shell script.  To fix the problem, remove the attribute using the command

[source,shell]
-----
  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine shell-script
-----
and resume the build.

=== MLRISC

Fixed a bug in the way that floating-point comparisons were being generated
for the **AMD64** target (bug 234).

=== Runtime System

We now use *POSIX* signal handling on *FreeBSD* (instead of the "Traditional BSD"
signal handling).

=== ML-LPT

The `AntlrStreamPos` structure now has a `FilePos` substructure that has the
`INTEGER` signature.  This substructure defines the representation type for
positions and can be used to write code that will be portable against any
future changes in that type (__e.g.__, the switch from `Position.int` to `int`
in 110.94).
