== Summary

This release fixes a critical bug in runtime system, as well has including
some additional changes to the compiler.

== Details

=== Installation

While the {dist-dir}smlnj-x86-{version}.pkg[installer]
for {version} works on macOS 10.14 Mojave, building from source
requires some extra steps.

=== SML/NJ Library

Renamed the function `CharBufferPP.openOut` to `openBuf`, and added the
`TextPP` structure that supports pretty printing to either an output
stream (like `TextIOPP`) or a character buffer (like `CharBufferPP`).

=== ASDL


=== Compiler

A number of changes to internal representations as part of the preparation for
supporting 64-bit targets.  See the {history}[change log] for details.

== Bugs

Here is a list of tracked bugs fixed (or closed) with this release, please see the
https://smlnj-gforge.cs.uchicago.edu/projects/smlnj-bugs[bug tracker]
for more details.

=== A note about 64-bit support

Apple is in the process of deprecating 32-bit support in macOS.
With macOS 10.14 Mojave, compiling 32-bit applications, such as the SML/NJ
runtime system, requires using an older SDK.
The SML/NJ {dist-dir}smlnj-x86-{version}.pkg[installer],
however, works without issue on macOS 10.14 Mojave.

We have been working on 64-bit support since 110.82 we expect to have it in place
before the release of macOS 10.15.
