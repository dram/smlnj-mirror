== Summary

== GitHub Migration

With this release, we have migrated the bug tracking infrastructure to a system using
**GitHub** issues.  We have prepopulated the issues for the legacy repository with
the entries from the old bug database.

Since issues are associated with a repository, we now have separate trackers for the
legacy and main development versions.  While most bugs that are present in one version
will also be present in the other version, it is not necessary to create two issues
when reporting a bug.

== Details

=== Compiler

Update LLVM to 14.0.5

=== Runtime System

=== SML/NJ Library

--
  * Added the `findAndRemove` function to `ORD_MAP` interface.
  * Generalized comparisons on ordered maps; added `equiv` and
    `extends` functions to `ORD_MAP` interface and made type of
    `collate` more polymorphic.
  * The *SExp* library now uses *Scheme* syntax for string values.
  * The *SExp* parser accepts empty files as valid input (producing
    an empty list of S-Expressions).
--

=== Installation

The `config/install.sh` script continues to work as before.  We have added a `-dev`
command-line option to enable cross compilation (__i.e.__, it compiles *LLVM*
for all of the supported target architectures).

== Closed Issues

Here is a list of the issues that are fixed (or closed) with this release.
We include the original bug numbers for bugs that were reported using the
old https://smlnj-gforge.cs.uchicago.edu/projects/smlnj-bugs[bug tracker].
