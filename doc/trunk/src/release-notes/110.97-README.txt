== Summary

== Details

=== SML/NJ Library

There are a number of additions to the **SML/NJ Library** in
this release.

  * Added the `disjoint` function to the `ORD_SET` signature.

  * Added `RESET` as a command to the `ANSITerm` structure.

  * Added the structure `FNVHash` to the `Util` library.  This
    structure implements the
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler–Noll–Vo_hash_function[Fowler-Noll-Vo]
    hashing algorithm.

  * Added a new library for generating and manipulating "Universally
    Unique Identifiers" (`UUID/uuid-lib.cm`).

=== Documentation

Additional manual pages have been added for the commands that are part
of the standard installation.

=== Installation

We have updated our infrastructure for building MSI files for Windows
to use the latest version of the https://wixtoolset.org[WiX Toolset].
This change should not have any impact on the user-side of the
installation process.

=== 32-bit macOS issues

While the {dist-dir}smlnj-x86-{version}.pkg[x86 installer]
for {version} works on **macOs** 10.14 Mojave, building from source
requires some extra steps because the version of **Xcode**
distributed for Mojave does not include a 32-bit SDK.

Another issue that you may encounter
when building on **macOs** 10.14 Mojave is an error message for a shell
script of the form

.....
  /bin/sh: bad interpreter: Operation not permitted
.....

This error arises because the `com.apple.quarantine` attribute is set on the
shell script.  To fix the problem, remove the attribute using the command

[source,shell]
-----
  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine shell-script
-----
and resume the build.
