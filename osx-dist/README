This directory contains the infrastructure for building a Mac OS X installer
for SML/NJ on Intel hardware.  The basic command

	./build-pkg.sh $VERSION

will build a signed installer package for the specified version (e.g., 110.76).
This script assumes that the distribution files have already been uploaded
to the standard distribution site

	http://smlnj.cs.uchicago.edu/dist/working/$VERSION/

and that the targets file is initialized correctly.

The signing of the package depends on the user having the correct developer
certificate.  The script currently knows about John Reppy's cert, but the
script can be generalized by adding other user IDs.

In addition to the build script, the other important file is

	components/distribution_xml.in

which is used to generate the distribution.xml file that controls the installer.
See Apple's documentation for more details.
