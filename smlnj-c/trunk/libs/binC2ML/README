The functor binaryC in the files
		binary-C-file.sig.sml
		binary-C-file.sml
can be used to convert binary C data (e.g. structs) into their
SML/NJ C interface equivalents.  This is useful for importing 
C binary data from files, for example.

To use the convertor, instantiate a C interface for the source
C data.  Note that it is possible to import C data created by a 
C compiler with different characteristcs (e.g. sizes) than the
target (SML/NJ) platform.  Then, instantiate the binaryC functor
with this C interface.  The function toBits converts an SML/NJ
ctype instance to bits in a Word8Vector.  Conversely, the function
fromBits converts the bits in a Word8Vector, given a ctype, to 
the corresponding C data.  

The toBits/fromBits operations are valid only on flat types; no
pointers or functions.  binaryC raises an exception when asked
to convert non-flat types.

The file load.sml serves to illustrate the process described above.
