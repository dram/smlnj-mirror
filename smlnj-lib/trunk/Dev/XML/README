This directory contains a small library for parsing XML files.  It does
not support validation (e.g., against a DTD or Schema).  The basic idea
is that the user supplies a "schema" module that describes the elements
and attribute representation of an XML document.  From this, one builds
and XML tree representation

	structure MyXMLTree = XMLTreeFn (MyXMLSchema);

and an XML parser

	structure MyXMLParser = XMLParserFn (MyXMLTree);

A generic XML schema (that allows any element name) is provided.

For a more complete library for XML processing, use the fxp library.

TODO:
  support a SAX-type parsing interface
  support a DOM API a la TinyXML (http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml)
  or TinyXML-2 (http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml2/)
