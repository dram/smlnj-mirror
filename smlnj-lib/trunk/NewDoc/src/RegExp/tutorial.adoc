== Introduction

The *RegExp Library* is designed for flexibility; it allows mixing and
matching of different front-end syntax with back-end engines, as well
as supporting arbitrary input sources.
This flexibility, however, comes at the cost of making some of the
simple applications a bit less obvious.  This tutorial shows how the
*RegExp Library* can be used in a variety of common applications.

== Assembling an Regular Expression Matcher

Before we can do anything else, we must assemble a regular-expression
matcher.  For the purposes of this tutorial, we will use a combination
of the `AwkSyntax` front end and the `BackTrackEngine` back end.
