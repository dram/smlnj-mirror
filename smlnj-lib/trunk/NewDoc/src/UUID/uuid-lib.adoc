== Overview

The *UUID Library* is a library for generating
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier[
UUIDs (__**U**niversally **U**nique **ID**entifiers__)], which
are also known as GUIDs (__**G**lobally **U**nique  **ID**entifiers__).
It currently only supports generating Variant 1, Type 4 UUIDs, which
are random bit strings (these are the UUIDs generated by the `NewGuid`
function on **Microsoft Windows**).
