== Overview

The *SExp Library* supports the reading and writing of structured data using
the S-expression syntax.  It is a work in progress, and does not fully conform with
any formal S-exp specification.

- End-of-line comments begin with a semicolon (`;`)

- An S-Expression is either an atomic token (boolean, number, symbol, or
  string), a quoted expression, or a list of S-Expressions enclosed in brackets.

- Quoted expressions are formed by the single-quote character (``'``) followed
  by an expression.

- Lists are be delimited by matched pairs of `()` `[]` or `{}`, nested freely.

- List items are separated with whitespace (space, tab, newlines, or carriage
  returns).

- Symbols (or _identifiers_) begin with an initial character followed by
  zero or more _subsequent_ characters, where an initial character is
  either a letter or one of the characters `-+.@!$%&*/:<=>?^_~` and
  a subsequent character is either an initial character, a decimal digit,
  or the character `#`.

- Booleans are represented by the literals `#f` (false) and `#t` (true).

- Numbers are either signed integers or floating-point numbers; the
  sign (if present) is one of "'+'," "`-`," or "`~`".

- Integers may be specified in decimal without any prefix, or in hexadecimal
  with the prefix "0x".  In hex, the value is assumed to be unsigned, so -255
  should be written "-0xff" rather than "0x-ff".

- The format of a floating point number is described by the following
  regular expression:
+
[latexmath]
++++
  \mathit{sign}^{?}\,\mathit{digit}^{+}\,\mathtt{.}\;\mathit{digit}^{+}\,
  ([\mathtt{eE}]\,\mathit{sign}^{?}\,\mathit{digit}^{+})^{?}
++++
+
Notably, "`1.`" and "`.1`" are invalid and "`1`" is parsed as an
integer -- floats must have a dot with digits
on both sides.

- Strings are enclosed in double quotes (``"``).
+
The difference between symbols and strings is that symbols are represented as
Atom.atom types, so equality comparisons are more efficient.

The original version of the library was written by Damon Wang
at the University of Chicago.  It has since been modified and
maintained by John Reppy.
