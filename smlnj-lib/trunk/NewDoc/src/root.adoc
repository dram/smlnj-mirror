== Introduction

The **Standard ML of New Jersey Library** (**SML/NJ Library**)
is a collection of over 200 modules grouped into 14 libraries.
It was designed to build on the {sml-basis-url}/index.html[**Standard ML Basis Library**]
by providing higher-level and application-specific services
that were out of scope for the Basis Library.
The **SML/NJ Library** is distributed as part of both the
https://smlnj.org[**SML/NJ**] and
https://mlton.org[**MLton SML Compiler**] systems.
