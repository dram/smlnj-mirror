TODO list for the HTML4 library:

  - fix bugs in conformance tests (these are parsing issues)
  - streamline parser; we should be able to fold the processing of attributes (html4-attr.{lg})
    into the scaner/parser for elements.
  - the printer should be "PRE" aware.
  - add the rest of the standard HTML4 entites to html4-entities.sml
