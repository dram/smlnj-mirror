This is a library for generating "Universally Unique IDentifiers" (UUIDs).
It currently only supports generating Variant 1, Type 4 UUIDs, which
are random bit strings (these are the UUIDs generated by the `NewGuid`
function on Microsoft Windows).

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier for
more information about GUIDs.
