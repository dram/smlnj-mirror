\chapter{Fully Transparent Generative Functors}\label{ch:ftgf}


% \emph{Does generativity give more computational power similar to adding references to a recursion-free?}
% \emph{Claim: Generativity doesn't cause nontermination.}

% \emph{Analogy between module (incomplete type and value specifications) and core (types don't include effect information)}
% \emph{inlining exploits value information for optimizations}
