LaTeX2e UofC Thesis Macros
==========================

latest version 26 Jan 2006
by Craig Wiegert <cwiegert@alumni.uchicago.edu>


This bundle contains a LaTeX2e document class file and assorted files
implementing a style for University of Chicago dissertations.  The
original implementation was written by Nathan Dunfield and Bryan Clair,
and has been modified over the years by a cast of grad students
including Martin Pergler, Brad Holden, Luisa Rebull, and John
Vaillancourt.

The files include:

* ccw_chithesis.cls - the thesis class
* astroextras.sty - used to be a part of the class file; split into its
  own file to keep the thesis class discipline-neutral
* apj.bst - my slightly revised version of a standard BibTeX style file
  for author-year cites
* template.tex - sample thesis template, including commented-out
  sections pertaining to (ApJ) journal submission
* figure.tex - sample figure from John's package
* table.tex - sample table from John's package
* bh_abstract.tex - separate file to produce B&H abstract
* oldthesis.tar - archive of older versions of the thesis class file


NOTE: The thesis class file contains a bunch of useful comments in the
header that are worth reading.  In order to use the thesis class file,
you will need a reasonably current version (1998/04/08) of the
"setspace" style as well as the "footmisc" style.  These can be found on
the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (www.ctan.org) if your local
distribution doesn't have them (and if that's the case, bug your
sysadmin for a long overdue upgrade).  Also, BibTeX is your friend;
learn how to use it!  If you want author-year citations, check out the
"natbib" package, and also look into "astronat".
