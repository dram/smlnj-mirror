Title: matching exn constructor against valspec fails
Keywords: signature matching, representation
Submitter: sestoft@research.att.com
Date:      3 April 1995
Version:   107.8 
System:    SGI MIPS
Severity:  Compiler bug
Problem:  

Matching an exception constructor against a valspec causes code in
cps/convert.sml to fail.

Code: 

    structure S : sig val e : exn end = struct exception e end;

Transcript: 

    Standard ML of New Jersey, Version 107.8, March 24, 1995 [new runtime]
    - structure S : sig val e : exn end = struct exception e end;
    The lvar 166 is not in the current hashtable!
    Error: Compiler bug: TypeInfo hash table in convert.sml

Comments:

The problem did not come up in `real code', but is a side effect of an
attempt to understand the implementation of signature matching.

The problem occurs also if the exception takes an argument.  Matching
a value constructor against a valspec works.  Both cases were OK in
0.93.

Fix:

The problem is probably in signature matching (trimmings), in
representation analysis, or in their interaction.

[Zhong Shao:] The problem is that signature matching didn't generate
the correct thinning function when an exception is matched against a
val spec.

The above bug is now fixed by slightly changing the "modules/sigmatch.sml" 
file (based on the version in 107.8). [New sigmatch.sml file supplied.]

Comments: (these are on the 72/311/317 variant *)

   + according to 311, this should compile; but perhaps 317
     indicates that it should not.  i would expect abstypes to
     behave like datatypes inside the "with".  so Foo would be
     an eqtype inside, and abstract outside;  but 317 shows how
     Foo being an eqtype inside could leak out.
   + note how, despite the error, it is compiled w/ bogus type ''a -> _
     (and hence one can crash the machine)
   + also note the odd location: 147-159, instead of something
     like std_in:147.0-147.60

Title: selecting an integer component from arg to C function
Keywords: C
Submitter: Peter Bailey (Peter.Bailey@cs.anu.edu.au)
Date: 4/5/95
Version: 107
Severity: major
Problem: 
  When you call a C function from ML, and are selecting an integer
  component from the argument that is passed (ie. with REC_SELINT ...)
  the INT_MLtoC conversion that is applied fails when the ML integer
  was negative. The code of INT_MLtoC just performs a right shift (>>)
  of the value to undo the boxing representation, and this works fine
  for positive numbers, but fails for negative numbers, give a result
  (on a SPARC running SunOS 4.1.3 with gcc as the compiler) of (2^31)-1.
  I checked through the list of C functions that exist at the moment
  in the C libraries, and all of them that require integers in their
  arguments would be expecting non-negative integers.

System(s) and Version:	SML/NJ 0.93 compiler

Problem: 		makeml uses "rm -f" on a directory

Transcript: 		(Made up transcript...)

# rm -f mo
# fsck /dev/sd01
Unreferenced inode 294, reattach? (y/n) 
etc...

Comments:
Certain simple-minded operating systems (e.g. COHERENT) implement rm
as a simple unlink.  On these systems, an ordinary user is prevented
from removing a directory.  The user must use the setuid program
"rmdir" which checks to make certain that the directory is empty
before removing it.

If you do not provide the -r (recurse) flag to rm, it will NOT
recurse.  The -f flag (force) tells rm to try to remove even if it
doesn't think it's a good idea.  SO, "rm -f dir" will cause the link
to "dir" to be removed, usually leaving an inconsistant filesystem,
(unless there happens to be another hard link pointing at that
directory tree).

If you are going to remove whole directory trees, it is a REALLY good
idea to use "rm -rf dir".

Not many systems use V7-style filesystems any more, but the fix is
harmless on modern filesystems, and saves headaches on the older
systems.

Fix:

use "rm -rf" instead of "rm -f" throughout makeml.

Comment: [Lal, 3/21/97]
  [This] is fixed. I have tested the fix on both Digital Unix and OSF/1
  v3.2. 

  The problem was that division is being done in floating point
  registers, and floating point divide-by-zero is supposed to return
  inf. The only reliable mechanism to generate an integer divide-by-zero
  trap is to use a call_pal instruction with a gentrap function code. 

  I therefore test for zero explicitly in the generated code and branch
  to a shared and off-line piece of code that sets up the pal call.

  There is a small change required to the runtime system. Signal
  handling under Digital Unix is still screwed up. The machine ucontext
  is not being passed correctly to the signal handler.

Comments:               
This may be the same as previously submitted module-system bugs, but it
looks different.  It seems to have at least two different
manifestations, one being that an object of type In.x simply won't
unify with one of type In.b_x.  To see this, simply change the type
of field "a" in b_x to be "bool" instead of "t", i.e.
	type b_x = {a: bool, b: int}
The result is:

Comments:

The first problem is that the "." separating the fraction from the
integer part is lost.
The second problem is one of design. Should real numbers be output
in a "nice" format or a "useful" format? As it stands now, the output
(a) omits zero fractions, i.e. ".0", and (b) uses a lower-case "e" for
exponents. This makes the output illegal as Standard ML input.

The first problem was caused by using the wrong variable name in
(sml-nj/boot/real-format.sml)realToGenStr: "num" should have been "frac".

Comment [jhr]
  The missing decimal point has already been fixed.
  The question about ".0", I'll have to think about, since it ties into
  the new basis's definition of Real.toString.  I think it is likely that
  the syntax of real literals will be liberalized to include "e".

 [jhr, 5/20/97]
  The first two cases have been fixed.  The third case is no longer
  a bug in printing, but is a bug in the SML/NJ scanner:

Comment:
If you stare at it long enough, you see that one "outfile" should be "outFile".
We reallyn need to have more precise messages for mismatches of record/tuple

Problem:
If I repeatedly load a fixed ML-file of the form

  structure S = struct end;
  open S;

and export the result using exportML, the size of the created binary will be
proportional to the number of times I loaded the source file. This looks like
a bug to me. Note that there is no problem if the line "open S" is missing.
Comments: [Appel, 12/15/95]
Well, this is a bug, more or less.  It's not a trivial bug to fix, however.
The best solution is to use the Compilation Manager (available with
version 108.x for any x) for your edit-compile-debug cycle, and avoid
this top-level-interactive-loop problem entirely.

We may or may not be able to fix this bug in the long run for the
top-level interactive loop.

Comments:
The type of the resule should have 'a instead of 'b in both places:

This breaks the soundness of the language, and should be fixed as soon

Comment [dbm]: this bug is caused by the function MTDeriv.mtderivDec
called by Compile.elaborate (build/compile.sml).  This function specializes

Comment: [jhr, 1/23/96]
Actually, I think the problem is that we are not yet handling the "0w" prefix.
When I implemented this, the SMLSL specified that these functions did not
process the prefix, so they are just converting the "0".  Since then, the
SMLSL specification has changed, but not the implementation.

Comments:
The last line of the sources.cm file refers to a completely unused
library (with a stable-file).  On the Alpha, this situation leads
to the wrong value for the string literal s5 (I'm quite sure the
problem is in s5 and not in the sum or print functions).
But when the library reference is deleted from the sources.cm file,
it works fine!  Or, on the HP-PA, with or without the library reference,
it works fine!  Most strange.

Comments:		

Using Solaris' `truss' command, I was able to verify that the hanging
process loops entirely in user code. It makes no system calls whatsoever.

The symptoms are similar, but slightly different in 109. There,
it seems to hang right after the first call to OS.Process.system.

NotAFix:			

This doesn't fix the hanging problem, but there is another bug
in sml-nj/boot/Unix/os-process.sml: a typo causing SIGINT to be

generating P.BOXEDUPDATE for word32 assignments.  The new code,
starting at line 50, is:

	  | CONty(tyc,_) =>
	      if       equalTycon(tyc,intTycon)
		orelse equalTycon(tyc,wordTycon)
		orelse equalTycon(tyc,word8Tycon)
	      then P.UNBOXEDUPDATE
	      else if       eqTycon(tyc,realTycon)
		     orelse eqTycon(tyc,word32Tycon)
		     orelse eqTycon(tyc,exnTycon)
		     orelse eqTycon(tyc,contTycon)
		     orelse eqTycon(tyc,arrayTycon)
		     orelse eqTycon(tyc,refTycon)
		   then P.BOXEDUPDATE
		   else P.UPDATE

I don't know why some of the tests use `equalTycon' and other
`eqTycon'.  Please look into this.

[jhr, 2/213/96] Thanks for the bug fix; it will appear in 109.3 (we
just built 109.2 yesterday).  The difference between equalTycon and
eqTycon is that the latter does a "shallow" compare.  I've changed
this to equalTycon in this case.

Comments:

Unrelated, but while I'm writing this bug report, I might as well
mention that the ml-yacc tar file has a junk directory ml-yacc/lib/.depend
and the smlnj-lib tar file has a junk directory smlnj-lib/.rs6000 .

Fix:

The problem is that the size of the result vector is set to be
the size of the input array rather than the number of items
actually extracted. CharVector.extract does this correctly.

Title: inconsistent type sharing with DEFtycs (Compiler bug)
Keywords: modules, sharing, signatures, instantiation
Submitter: John Reppy
Date: 3/11/96
Version: 109.x
Severity: major
Problem: "Compiler bug: setTycSaccess ERRORtyc" produced by
inconsistent type sharing.
Code:
Transcript:
html-elements.sml:8.9-202.5 Error: Inconsistent type sharing (DEFtyc/DEFtyc) attrs,attrs
Error: Compiler bug: setTycSaccess ERRORtyc
Comments:
This error arises when I use the signature in a functor argument,
The error message should say something about sharing of type abbreviations are
not allowed, and should be generated for the signature definition.

[dbm, 11/1/96] The SML '97 restrictions, when implemented, will rule
out this sort of signature.  Here are two signatures that should not
elaborate, but do without complaint in 109.19:

(* bug1037.sml *)
signature S =
sig
  type s = int
  type t = bool
  sharing type t = s
end;

(* bug1037.1.sml *)
signature S =
sig
  type s = int
  type a t = bool * 'a
  sharing type t = s    (* here the arities don't even agree! *)
end;

Instantiation is no longer being done when a signature is declared.
An error will occur when the sharing constraint is processed during
instantiation, for instance when the signature is used in a functor
parameter spec.  For SML '97, these should be rejected when the signature
is elaborated.

Comment:
  Sharing constraints involving rigid tycons like these are now rejected
  by instantiate.  However, instantiate is not called until the signature
  is used as a functor parameter or the constraint of an opaque match
  (abstraction), so the error will not occur when the signature is defined.

In Rand, seeds must be integer-valued. (Rand was implemented
using reals because, at the time, we didn't have large enough
integers.) This constraint should be added to the man
page. Alternatively, Rand could now be reimplemented using
integral types. 

Note that the Random structure provides a much better generator.

Problem: 
  There appears to be a bug in 108.18 to do with I/O and the interactive
  system.  It's very easy to reproduce: write a function to read from
  std_in up to eof and make a list out of it.  When you send ^D to
  std_in to finish your input, the top level correctly prints the
  returned list, but then immediately exits because std_in is closed.
  In older versions of SML the behavior was to re-open std_in, which I
  believe is correct.

Comment:
 [jhr, 7/29/1996]
  The problem has to do with the fact that you specify stdOut as the index stream
  (the last argument to newSource).  I think this is causing stdOut to be closed
  when you close the source, which causes an exception to be raised in the
  interactive top-level loop.  I suggest you use NONE as the last argument to
  newSource.

  I think that the Index code is defunct anyway, so we will probably remove this
  from the source.
 [jhr, 4/3/97]
  This was a feature, not a bug, and anyway it is gone now (I removed the
  index stuff).

The problem seems to be that SunOS and Solaris are not ABI compatible.  The
short-term fix is to regenerate the sml.sparc heap image on a Solaris
machine.  In the longer term, we will either make heap images OS specific,
or introduce some kind of linking mechanism to dynamically redefine OS

Title: modmap cleanup expensive
Keywords: modmap, top level
Submitter: Dave MacQueen
Date: 11/5/96
Version: 109.21
Severity: major
Problem: 
SCStatEnv (env/scstatenv.sml) doesn't cleanup the modmaps when
layering its augmented static environments (function atop), which
means that inaccessible structures, signatures, functors etc. 
may not be garbage collected because they still appear in the
modmaps.  This could cause some noticeable space bloat.

The modmaps in the top level static environments are now cleaned up by
applying unSC and then SC to the sc staticEnv.  This is unacceptably
expensive.  Need a new method of cleaning up, or need to do this only
occasionally.

The following code is in the main loop in build/evalloop.sml, and
it appears to be the culprit in a fairly noticeable slowdown in
the interactive system, especially on slow systems (see message
below).

		    val newEnv = SCEnv.Env.concatEnv
		  ({static=newenv,dynamic=new_dynenv,symbolic = new_symenv},
			   #get localEnvRef ())
		  (* refetch localEnvRef because execution may
		   have changed its contents *)

It looks like the reason this is slow is the definition of
SCEnv.Env.concatEnv:

      fun concatEnv(a,b) = SC(E.concatEnv(unSC a, unSC b))

In this case, parameter b is the contents of localEnvRef, which in
sml-cm has a lot of stuff in it, and SC is having to rescan this
environment and rebuild the modmap at each top-level binding.  I
guess this drastic approach is taken to make sure that inaccessible
entities (types, signatures, modules) get cleaned out of the modmap
component of the top-level environment so they can be
garbage-collected.

We need to find a more efficient way of doing this, assuming this
is the correct explanation of the slowdown.

Subject: Top-level declaration processing overhead in 109.16?

I've noticed that there seems to be a large overhead associated with
processing a top-level declaration in SML/NJ 109.16.

E.g., it makes a big difference whether one types

- val x = 1; val x = 1; val x = 1; val x = 1; val x = 1; val x = 1; val x = 1;

or 

- val x = 1 val x = 1 val x = 1 val x = 1 val x = 1 val x = 1 val x = 1;

On a slow SPARC (SPARCstation 1+) the latter takes about 2 seconds, and
the former takes about 14 seconds (two seconds per top-level declaration).

On a fast (unloaded!) SPARC, of course, one hardly notices the difference...

In contrast, with SML/NJ 0.93, the former takes only slightly more than
1 second, and the later seems to take hardly any time.

Is this a known problem?  I'm worried about teaching with an implementation
in which students must put up with such response times...

We've seen a similar bug under FreeBSD and NetBSD on x86 machines.
The problem is that calls to getrusage may not return monotonically
increasing values for CPU time.  It has something to do with the way
that CPU usage is computed.  You could see if this is the problem
on your machine by adding "defined(OPSYS_LINUX)" to the #ifdef
on line 66 of runtime/kernel/unix-timers.c.  Let me know if this fixes
the problem (or if it doesn't).

Date: 5/8/96
Version: 109
System: ?
Severity: major
Problem: 
The handling of signals in SML-NJ 109 seems to be spoiled if a heap image
is saved with exportML, for example in the following way:

Code:
fun xML filename banner =
  let val runtime = List.hd (SMLofNJ.getAllArgs())
      val exec_file = IO.open_out filename

      val _ = IO.output (exec_file,
			 String.concat
			 ["#!/bin/sh\n",
			  runtime, " @SMLdebug=/dev/null @SMLload=", filename,
                          ".heap\n"])
                             (*"@SMLdebug=..." sends GC messages to /dev/null*)

	val _ = IO.close_out exec_file;
	val _ = OS.Process.system ("chmod a+x " ^ filename)
    in exportML (filename^".heap");
       print(banner^"\n")
    end;

xML "Goofy" "New image starts here...";

Comments:
Starting the new image Goofy, one finds that Ctrl/C aborts the program,
rather than just causing an interrupt (with printing of "Interrupt").

After a very large image has been saved (example: the Isabelle system),
the effects of Ctrl/C and Ctrl/D become pretty unpredictable.  In the
Isabelle case, Ctrl/C has no effect, and a looping/long-running
calculation cannot be interrupted.  In another case, Ctrl/D is not
caught and interpreted as EOF (in the end_of_stream function),
but causes immediate program exit.

I was able to reproduce this bug in 109, but not in 109.11.  Here is the
109.11 code:

fun xML filename banner =
  let val runtime = List.hd (SMLofNJ.getAllArgs())
      val exec_file = TextIO.openOut filename

      val _ = TextIO.output (exec_file,
			 String.concat
			 ["#!/bin/sh\n",
			  runtime, " @SMLdebug=/dev/null @SMLload=", filename,
                          "-image\n"])
                             (*"@SMLdebug=..." sends GC messages to /dev/null*)

      val _ = TextIO.closeOut exec_file;
      val _ = OS.Process.system ("chmod a+x " ^ filename)
    in SMLofNJ.exportML (filename ^ "-image");
       print(banner^"\n")
    end;

Comments: [Neil Inala, 8/13/1996]
The following code segments all give the same perpetual GC problem
with the divide-by-zero exception.  It seems to have something to
do with refs.  I don't think the particular value of any of the
reals gives a problem (except of course 0.0).

These both compile and f(1.0) executes fine, but
trying to get the value of v gives perpetual GC:

  val v = ref 4.0;
  fun f(x) = v := x / 0.0;

or:

  val v = ref 4.0;
  fun f(x) = v := x / real(0);


This compiles and f(1.0) and g(1.0) execute fine, but
trying to get the value of v gives perpetual GC:

  val v = ref 4.0;
  fun f(x) = (v := x / 0.0; v)
  fun g(x) = (v := x / 0.0; !v)

This compiles and f(1.0) executes fine, but
trying to get the value of v or w gives perpetual GC:
  val v = ref 4.0;
  val w = ref 5.0;
  fun f(x) = w := (v := x / 0.0; !v)

Comment: [jhr, 8/13/1996]
I wonder if trapping divide by zero is disabled and the looping
is the printer trying to print a NaN?  I guess that moving to
non-trapping arithmetic should fix this problem.

Severity: 		major
Problem: 		CM+exportFn creates too large images
Code:
Transcript:
Comments:

I'm observing large variations in the sizes of images (from exportFn)
when using CM. Specifically, when doing a clean build (all CM sub-directories
removed, newly started sml-cm process) so that CM recompiles everything,
the images are from 29% to 70% larger than normal. If I then restart
sml-cm and CM.make() again, the exported images are back to normal sizes.
I suspect some form of space leak, perhaps in CM (but shoudln't CM.clear()
empty all in-core caches?).

Here is a list of some of my SML applications, and the image sizes
after a 1st (clean) build, and then after a 2nd (trivial) build.

application	1st build	2nd build	1st/2nd increase

rml2c:		2008828		1181332		70%
rmli:		1130652		799940		41%
rmli-V2:	1270468		873288		45%
emil:		849620		659064		29%
xdrgen:		585316		396336		48%

Comment: [blume, 8/12/96]
You said you are using exportFn.  Do your projects themselves make any
references to CM?  If this is not the case (the size of the images
seem to support this), then CM has nothing to do with it, because all
of it should get stripped out by exportFn.

[Mikael Pettersson, 3/13/97]
08/12/96 I reported a problem I've been having with 109.16 and some
earlier versions: exportFn created overly large images for "1st builds"
using CM. Since then, whatever caused this seems to have been fixed,
because now (with 109.25 and 109.25.2) the "1st build" produces images
of normal sizes. However, for some reason the "2nd build" (which is a
CM.make() that doesn't have to recompile anything) now results in slightly
(a few %) _larger_ images. (Nothing else has changed. Same machine,
same OS, same SML code.)

So perhaps #1076 can be taken off the openbugs list now?

Obviously it's time for a rousing game of find the sharing constraint.
The compiler could make the game easier to win by attaching unique ids

It turned out there was no missing sharing constraint --- I had
misspelled the name of a record element ("unsolve").  That, too, would
have been easier to find had I *known* all the ?'s matched...

Comments: [Findler]
Just in case, I did reboot and it's not the problem. I did narrow it down a
little more:

- Real.toString 1.1;

uncaught exception overflow

- Real64.toString 1.1;

uncaught exception overflow

and

- fun f x = f x;
GC #0.0.0.1.4.158:   (30 ms)
val f = fn : 'a -> 'b
- f 1.1;

runs for a while just fine.

So, I looked at real-format.sml in the boot directory and saw that it was
calling realGFormat (1.1,12) and that the exception was being raised in
decompose when it is called with (12,0,fn _=>12). So, htat is calling a
local function mkdigits with argument (1.1,12), which overflows.

Well, to make a long story short, (well, just to end up my long story, I
guess :-)

- floor 1.1;

uncaught exception overflow

That's as far as I can go, since:

real64.sml:    val floor = Assembly.A.floor

and I wouldn't have the foggiest if I looked at that code.

Title: CM_ROOT environment variable not seen by cm
Keywords: cm
Submitter: Anthony Shipman <tusc.com.au!als>
Date: 10/9/96
Version: 109.18
Severity: major
Problem: 
  If I do

      $ CM_ROOT=some.cm sml
      - CM.make();

  then it ignores the CM_ROOT and uses sources.sml.  If I set the root
  manually it works.

      $ sml
      - CM.set_root "some.cm";
      - CM.make();
Fix:
The bug is on config/install.sh.

CM uses its own ``export'' routine (in place of SMLofNJ.exportML),
which makes sure that environment variables are re-read when the
system comes back up.  The install script doesn't use CM's ``export''
function, so changes in environment variables are not honored anymore.

Please, replace the line that says

	SMLofNJ.exportML "sml-cm";

with

	CM.export ("sml-cm", NONE);

in config/install.sh.

Comments: [jhr, 10/9/96]
Wouldn't it be better to just call OS.Process.getEnv when you need the value
of CM_PATH.  Also, there is a mechanism in the compiler for doing this kind
of initialization (sml-nj/boot/cleanup-sig.sml, sml-nj/boot/cleanup.sml).
The advantage of using the builtin mechanism is that when some unsuspecting
user does an exportML, it will behave correctly.

Problem: 
I have some type checking code that has the following relevant lines.

fun check_val_decls(...) =
let
    ......
    val init_result = ...  (* something of known type UnifyResult *)
    val final_result = do_val_decls(struct_tag, inherits, init_result)

....

and get_let_type(...) =
let
    ...
    val decl_rslt = do_val_decls(let_tag, inherits, rslt_in)
    ...
in ... end

and do_val_decls(
	let_tag: Tag,
	inherits: Inherits, 
	rslt_in: UnifyResult
	): UnifyResult =
let ... end


I got the following error message where line 1296 is the second use of
do_val_decls()

../semantics/type_check.sml:1296.2-1296.58 Error: unresolved flex record
(can't tell what fields there are besides #subst)


It appears that because the first encounter of do_val_decls() was in
check_val_decls() it decided that the result type of do_val_decls() was
unknown but at least was a record with a field 'subst'.

When it got to line 1296 it decided to report its confusion.  A solution
was to add a constraint

    val decl_rslt: UnifyResult = do_val_decls(let_tag, inherits, rslt_in)

I think the type error reporting needs some more smarts.

  The problem is that the type of empty *in the absyn* contains a local
  stamp for q that has been replaced by a pid in the static environment
  that is used for printing.  Thus the version of q in the absyn for
  the empty declaration is not equal (equalTycon) to q in the static
  environment that is passed to the prettyprinting function.

The code above is the smallest that would exhibit the bug.  For example,
any of the following changes will make the bug disappear:

* Removal of the empty signature constraint
* Removal of function FVb
* Removal of function FVus
* Changing the "and" to "fun", making the definitions of FVu' and FVus'
  non-recursive

Comments:

This involves an SML'96 feature (type abbreviations in signatures),
so it may be that the compiler actually does what SML'96 requires.
Until the new Definition is generally available, I cannot really
determine what the correct behaviour is supposed to be...

If I change the sharing constraint (*XXX*) to read: .. = StringSet.Key.key
instead, then things work fine. But why accept the FOO signature at the
top-level while rejecting an identical copy used as a functor argument?

In the excerpt of the new Definition (version 7.3.4) distributed with MLWorks,
it says that every longtycon involved in a type sharing constraint must
denote a flexible type name. However, I found no mention of whether a
type abbreviation of the kind found in the SET signature denotes a flexible
or rigid type name.

This example is condensed from a real application where I used the
smlnj-lib ORD_SET signature and BinarySetFn functor to build different
set-of-FOO structures.

Comments:
This declaration is accepted, but if we then use the signature

we get the error message

Title: CM path mechanism broken
Keywords: CM, CM_PATH
Submitter: Tomas Uribe <Theory.Stanford.EDU!uribe>
Date: 11/1/96
Version: 109.21
Severity: major
Problem: 
There seems to be a problem with CM's path mechanism; the CM_PATH is
not working properly.

In particular, CM seems to be looking for everything relative to the
directory where the .cm file is located. A simple example:

Running sml-cm from directory X, which is the same as CM_PATH:
	sources.cm is Alias foo/main.cm;
where X/foo/main.cm has a reference to "test.sml", which resides in X/test.sml.
Then CM will look for test.sml in the directory X/foo, not in the
directory X, even though the CM_PATH is X.

Also, the type of the CM.set_path function is not the one in the CM
manual, instead of
	string list -> unit
it is now
	string list option -> string list

Comment: [dbm] Is this the same as bug 1094?

Comment: [blume, 11/27/96]
  Indeed, this might be the same problem as 1094, but I doubt it.
  Instead, the logger seems to have misunderstood the PATH mechanism:
  CM only uses the path if the file can not be found in its
  default location.  The person writing the error report seems to
  assume that with CM_PATH set CM will _only_ look into the path.
  In other words, if sources.cm lists a.sml, and there is a file
  a.sml in the same directory that contains sources.cm, then this
  a.sml will be used -- regardless whether or not there is a CM_PATH,
  and regardless of whether or not the path contains another a.sml.

Comment: 
 [Matthias, 11/25/96]
  (This one is not owned by anyone, but it seems like it is at
  least CM-related.)
  I noticed the same problem.  My guess is that under certain
  circumstances a change in the implementation can introduce subtle
  changes to the resulting static environment.  (Ordering
  problems, optional redundant information (e.g. lambda-types)
  present or absent, ...).  A while back I traced a similar (but
  much more pronounced) effect to optional lambda-type
  annotations.  I fixed this bug by calculating the CRC without
  taking those lambda-types into account.  This is a rather nasty
  hack... I'd rather see such optional information disappear from
  static environments altogether.

 [Matthias, 2/19/97]
  I have the sneaking suspicion that bugs 1106, 1135, and 1154 are
  really all the same bug or at least very closely related.

 [Matthias, 3/31/97]
  I haven't seen a case of 1106 recently.  Has anyone else experienced
  spurious recompilations after adding print statements to other modules
  etc.?

 [Matthias, 4/16/97]
  Here is a small example that exhibits the problem.  If I remove the
  comments around "local", "in", and "end" below, then CM thinks it
  needs to recompile b.sml.  I believe this should never happen, because
  whether the definition of x is local or not isn't exposed in the
  functor's interface (which is given by the signature constraint).
  BTW, I get the same behavior for transparent and opaque signature
  matching.

  Likewise, adding any definition to the functor body thot is not
  mentioned in the signature will also cause b.sml to be recompiled.

  -Matthias

  The code is here:

  sources.cm::
  ---------------------------
  Group is
	  a.sml
	  b.sml
  ---------------------------

  a.sml::
  ---------------------------
  signature AS = sig

      val a: int -> int

  end

  functor AF ():> AS = struct
  (*    local *)
	  val x = 1
  (*    in *)
	  fun a n = n + x
  (*    end *)
  end
  ----------------------------

  b.sml::
  ----------------------------
  structure B = struct

      structure A = AF ()

      val b = A.a 10

  end
  ----------------------------

 [Blume, 4/21/97: cutoff compilation still broken]
  The following example breaks cutoff recompilation.  Un-commenting the
  type definition within functor AF causes b.sml to be recompiled:

  sources.cm::
  ----------------------------
  Group is a.sml b.sml
  ----------------------------

  a.sml::
  ----------------------------
  signature AS = sig

      val a: int -> int

  end

  functor AF ():> AS = struct

      (* type ttt = unit *)

      fun a (x: int) = x

  end
  ----------------------------

  b.sml::
  ----------------------------
  structure B = struct

      structure A = AF ()

      val b = A.a 10

  end
  ----------------------------
 [Zhong, 4/21/97]
  This really depends on whether ttt is used (or referred) by function
  a or not [rather, appears in a's interface type-dbm]. The current compiler
  considers all types can potentially be used, so it can definitely be optimized.

 [Matthias Blume, 4/21/97]
  I don't understand this.  Whether ttt is used in a or not shouldn't
  matter.  I can see that there might be problems if it becomes part of
  a's type.  But even then, suppose a depends on tttt, but a certain
  change to tttt does not change the type of a.  In this case cutoff
  compilation should also work (imo).

  Example:

  functor ...: sig val a: unit -> int end = struct

  type foo = unit   (* changes to foo do not change the type of a *)
  type ttt = int * foo

  fun a () = let val x: ttt = (3, ()) in #1 x end

  end

 [Zhong, 4/21/97]
  You are right. Unfortunately, the current static representations of the
  functor body is too coarse-grain to identify these differences. We'll
  see how to improve on this in the future.

 [Matthias, 4/30/97]
  Bug 1106 has been fixed, although I am personally not quite satisfied
  with the current status.  The example that I submitted is now
  processed correctly. But adding, deleting, or changing any type
  declarations in a functor's body (even when they are masked away by a
  signature contraint) will cause changes in the static environment,
  therefore in the pickle, and will therefore cause unnecessary
  recompilation.

  Zhong said that that's an artifact of the current implementation
  strategy.

 [dbm, 5/1/97]
  We'll have to work on this, and I hope we can eliminate any
  sensitivity to internal types.  Is the current effect caused by
  changes in the lambda types, Zhong?

 [Zhong, 5/1/97]
  No, it has nothing todo with lambda types. The functor body entity
  declaration currently faithfully record every type declaration it
  encounters --- so if any internal type declaration changes, the
  functor body entity expressions will change, thus the functor signature.

  If we want to get fancy, we can minimize the body entity expressions
  by throwing away all the unreachable type declarations, but this can
  be tricky to implement though.

  The bug is hard to reproduce which points to os specific problems.
  We have a file browser that reads directories and sorts files from 
  directories, then lists them in separate boxes.

  Note also that OS.FileSys.isDir raises a SysErr exception when the
  path is not a directory (instead of returning false). Try for instance:

Title: performance problems in top level loop
Keywords: performance, top-level
Submitter: Larry Paulson
Date: 11/26/96
Version: 109.21
System: ?
Severity: major
Problem: 
  I'm afraid I'm having serious problems with performance in version 109.21.  My 
  overnight Isabelle runs, which take under three hours under Poly/ML and just 
  over 3 1/2 hours with 108.5, are taking upwards of 10 hours (yes, 10) with 
  109.21.  I also noticed this interactively yesterday, when a Poly/ML job 
  started later on a slower computer finished before the same job under 109.21.  
  These runs consist almost entirely of execution, not compilation.

  I find this rather discouraging, especially in that I have gone to a lot of 
  trouble to port Isabelle to a recent version.  What do you think could be 
  wrong?

  ======= followup, 11/26/96
  Here are some elapsed time for building some of the various modules.  (All
  times are cumulative, measured from the start of the job.)

		  109.21		Poly/ML 3.1
  Pure:		5 minutes	3 minutes	[mostly compilation]
  FOL+ZF:		3:31 hours	22 minutes	[mostly proofs]
  HOL:		9:28 hours	1:18 hours	[mostly proofs]

  HOL would have suffered from being in competition with Poly/ML.  (The SML/NJ
  job starts at 22:00, while the Poly/ML one starts at 04:00.  Normally 6 hours
  is much more than enough.)

  The true slowdown is much worse than a factor of three, as you can see.
  Compatibility problems (such as calls to makestring) made the 109.21 job crash
  shortly after building HOL. 

  One particular example (ZF/ex/CoUnit) takes 70 seconds (including 1.6 seconds
  for GC) with 109.21, against 5.2 seconds with Poly/ML.

  The machine is a Sun SuperSPARC with 200+ meg.
Comments:
  Almost certainly due to top-level loop overhead, probably associated
  with maintenance of modmap in SCStaticEnv, i.e. running SC to often
  on too large a static environment.  Zhong is working on a fix:

    Dave, this is consistent with what I have found. The sml-cm compiler
    has the "CM" and "CMB" module in its top-level interactive environment.
    Both CM and CMB are huge structures. Everytime, we do a top-level
    compilation (thus doing the SCEnv.concatEnv), the old environment is 
    being un-SCed and then SCed again; and simplying SC-ing the "CM" and 
    "CMB" structures would take huge amount of time (around 0.7 sec on Sparc20).

    In 109.23m (the version I sent to you), I introduced some lazy-concat on 
    modmaps. This helps relieve the problem a bit, but not completely. I 
    a better fix though: the top-level env will always be SCStatenv, the
    result of elaborate should always be bare statEnv, the "concatEnv" operating
    should SC the new bare statEnv in the old modmap --- this will avoid 
    rebuilding the old modmap over and over again. After we do this, we can
    do reference counting on modmap to eliminate the potentional space-leak
    problem (similar to what Matthias did in stalePid).

 [jhr, 11/27/96]
  This is strange, and I'll look into it.  BTW, the fact that your shell script
  also receives the signal is just because it is in the same process group
  as SML.  SIGINT is delivered to all of the processes in the group associated with
  the tty.
 [jhr, 3/7/97]
  I think that what is happening is that the ^C kills the shell script, but the
  SML process is still running.  This is why there is no status message in the
  second example.  The infinite loop on SGI with ^C is not reproducable.  The
  example program provided seems to work fine.

  My problem is that some data neves seems to be freed
  (Or maybe it's just not returned to the operatins system).
  After allocating 10,000,000 integers several times, always overwriting
  the last one (using val it = Array.array(10000000,1);), I cannot
  get memory useage below 200Mb, even if I say.
  val it= <some low cost expr>;

  If I try to compile something, or do somthing else that probably will
  start a major GC, this seems to add to the 200Mb.
  This is strange, because repeated 'Array.array(10000000,1);)
  will not use more than 216Mb.

  Real memory consumption is also large.

Comments:

The file src/runtime/memory/mem-common.ins contains the following
code that dereferences "obj" _after_ having been freed:

/* MEM_FreeMemObj:

void MEM_FreeMemObj (mem_obj_t *obj)
{

        return;

    UnmapMemory(obj);

    FREE_MEMOBJ (obj);   

    VMSizeB -= obj->sizeB;

} /* end of MEM_FreeMemObj */

where FREE_MEMOBJ(p) is defined as FREE(p) in memory/mem-mmap.c and
FREE(p) is defined as _FREE(p) in include/ml-base.h and _FREE(p) is
further defined  (also in include/ml-base.h) as the C runtime's "free".

Unfortunately this bug does not reduce memory consumption.  At peak,
compiling the compiler under 109.24 requires >89Mb of memory
(virtual+physical, x86-linux).

Comments: Related to bug 1126.
 [Zhong Shao: 1/30/97]
  This seems to be related to the bug reported by Andrew. 
  The pretty-printer can't handle polymorphic constants in 109.24.
  For example, 

       val x = nil;

  will trigger the above message too. Polymorphic constants in
  109.24 are represented as functions, i.e., "nil" will be a function
  takes a type value and return 0. I did not figure out a way
  to pretty-print such values yet. 
Fix:
  print/ppobj.sml
     Fix the pretty-printing bug, BUG 1126 and BUG 1130, on polymorphic 
     constants such as [] and NONE.

Title:		Failure to reclaim garbage
Keywords:	garbage collection, arrays, large heaps
Submitter:	Matthias Blume (blume@cs.princeton.edu)
Date:		Jan 26, 1997
Version:	109.19 (probably all 109.*)
System:		x86-linux, alpha-osf1, ... (probably all)
Severity:	major
Problem:	Garbage collector doesn't free up memory previously
		by large arrays.
Code:
		fun listGarbage () = let
		    fun g 0 = [] | g n = 0 :: g (n - 1)
		    val data = g 100000
		in
		    hd data
		end

		fun arrayGarbage () = let
		    val data = Array.array (1000000, 0)
		in
		    Array.sub (data, 0)
		end

		fun loop f = (f (); loop f)
Transcript:
		When running `loop listGarbage;' I get the following
		information from `top' on the DEC Alpha.  The SIZE and
		RES fields settle quickly and then stay the same:

 ...

Comments:
    loop listGarbage;
    runs in constant space -- as one would hope and
    expect. However,
    loop arrayGarbage;
    runs out of virtual memory REALLY quickly, or rather,
    the machine comes to a virtual standstill because of
    the paging.

 [jhr, 1/26/97]
  This is not what is going on.  The garbage is being collected, it is
  a problem the sizing of heaps and VM.  I suspect that if you look at
  the amount of live data in the heap (as opposed to the amount of VM that
  the OS has allocated to the process), you would see constant space.

  These problems should be reduced when the new run-time comes online
  (by the end of Feb, I hope).

 [jhr, 2/19/97]
  I looked into bug #1131, which is the growing heap size when allocating
  large arrays, and I think I understand what is going on.  BTW, there is
  arrayGarbage does roughly 5 times more allocation per call than listGarbage.

  The story is that in the current collector, large arrays are allocated in
  the first generation.  When the first generation gets full, the GC sees that
  the array arena is completely full, and so allocates a somewhat larger arena
  for to-space.  Although only one (or zero) arrays actually get copied to
  to-space, the same thing will happen at the next GC (i.e., the array arena
  will be full and the GC will try to grow it).  While there is a limit on
  the growth of arenas, the minimum size must be large enough to hold all
  the potentially live data plus the extra space neede for the large array
  allocation which triggered the GC.  This is basically a pathological case
  for the current sizing policy, and I don't think that there is an easy fix.
  The new GC will not suffer from this problem, since the to-space memory is
  allocated lazily.

Fix: new runtime
Workaround:
  Force a collection prior to allocation, or periodically
  force two collections in a row.

  When trying to compile the latest version of CML on a modified version

  I also checked this with 109.24 and I get the same error.
Comments:
[Matthias]:
  This seems to be due to a bug in the new implementation of
  environments.  Zhong already complained about this.  CM does filtering
  on environments (environment + list of symbols -> new environment only
  containing those bindings from the old one that bind symbols in the
  list) for the case that one uses export filters in CM's description
  files.  This used to work perfectly in pre-109.24 versions, still
  works with static environments, but occasionally runs into the error
  above when dealing with full environments.
[JHR]:
  I just realized that this is this problem with

    structure Foo = CML_Foo

  needing to be rewritten as

  I suspect that this is due to some not-quite-synchronized clocks
  between host machine and fileserver, since I am unable to reproduce
  this effect here.

  But I will look into it.
 [JHR, 2/2/97]
  Unlikely, since the machine I was building on is the file server.
  Also, the source file should be days older than the bin file.

  BTW, do you cache timestamps?

 [Matthias, 2/19/97]
  I have the sneaking suspicion that bugs 1106, 1135, and 1154 are
  really all the same bug or at least very closely related.

  As noticed earlier, I have not been able to reproduce the bug even when
  uncommenting the code that caused it. (I had avoided the bug by turning
  a functor into a structure and copying it.) Some other  change I made to
  the source must have avoided it. I can therefore not give better indications
  on what causes the bug.

Version: 109.25
System: sparc/solaris
Severity: major
Problem: 
  exporftFn image size increased dramatically between 109.22 and 109.25.
  I have been using both versions 109.22 and 109.25 on sparc-solaris.
  When compiling with 109.25 the heap image generated by 
  SMLofNJ.exportFn seems to be a lot bigger:

  109.25
  -rw-r-----   1 toreba    9913224 Feb  4 10:05 abel.sparc-solaris

  109.22
  -rw-r-----   1 toreba    1267888 Feb  4 10:22 abel.sparc-solaris

  BTW. I also get small differences on an UltraSparc compared to 
  a Sparc-20. Even when the runtime and library sources are exactly the
  same and no compiling is done (only recovering and linking via CM).

  ==========
  Also noted by Peter Bertelsen (pmb@dina.kvl.dk):

    SMLofNJ.exportFn("dummy", fn (rt, args) => OS.Process.success) : unit;

  Even a trivial function like the one exported above produces a huge
  heap image (a bit larger than the original heap image for the entire
  compiler):

	  dummy.x86-linux :	8942172 bytes

	  sml-cm.x86-linux :	8724948 bytes

Comments:
 [jhr]The implementation of exportFn is tricky (making sure that everything
  that everything that is not needed is stripped away).  We must have
  broken something in going from 109.22 to 109.25.  Did you try your
  program with 109.23 or 109.24 by any chance?
 [jhr, with regard to UltraSparc/Sparc-20 differences]
  Have you tried both orders (i.e., compile on SS20 and then load on
  US vs. compile on US and load on SS-20)?

 [Zhong]
  I checked your code on my sparc 20, it seems to work out ok with the
  bare sml or sml-cm compiler (See attached, the image is about
  0.6Mbytes).

  I did see the problem if I run "sml" with CML loaded, it looks like
  that when we do exportFn, we are also exporting all the newly loaded
  environment (from CM). We'll fix this in the next release.

  In 109.24, I have temporarily turned off the structure-access lifting;
  this seems to be a bad idea. 

  For a function such as 

    fun f x = OS.Process.success

  in 109.24, the closure for "f" would contain a reference to the entire
  structure OS rather than to the actual field "OS.Process.success", thus 
  leading to the leak above.

Problem: Word.andb followed by Word.toString gives wrong answer
Code:

  Word.andb (!maskr, 0wxfffffff);
  Word.toInt (Word.andb (!maskr, 0wxfffffff));

  - val maskr = ref 0wx3fff;
  val maskr = ref 0wx3fff : word ref
  - Word.andb (!maskr, 0wxfffffff);
  val it = 0wx3fff : word
  - Word.toInt (Word.andb (!maskr, 0wxfffffff));
  val it = ~1073725441 : int

Comments: Works without the explicit dereference.
  [Zhong]This seems to be caused by something in the implementation of 
  the new "testu_31_31" primop. It works in version 109.15 (which
  uses realu31_i31 primop) but fails in 109.22 (which uses the
  testu_31_31 primop) to do the Word.toInt conversion.

  ========================
  [Lal] testu_31_31 looks correct. There appears to be some interaction with
  references that triggers this bug, because:

	  val x = 0wx3fff;
	  Word.toInt x;

  gives the correct answer, but:

	  val x = ref 0wx3fff;
	  Word.toInt (!x); 

  generates a wrong answer. This bug does not occur on the alpha or
  hppa, so it must be code generator related.

  =======================
  [jhr] It fails in 109.23 on the MIPS, so I suspect that it is a bug in generic.

  =======================
  [Lorenz] It first appears in the transition from 109.17 to 109.18.
  Here's a simpler test:

  - fun f x = Word.toInt x;
  val f = fn : word -> int
  - f 0w0;
  val it = ~1073741824 : int
  - Word.toInt 0w0;
  val it = 0 : int
  - 

  I suspect contract.sml, in particular the lines (in 109.25):

     | PURE(P.copy(p,n), [v], x, t, e as ARITH(a, [v2], x2, t2, e2)) => let
	 val v' = [ren v]
	 fun skip () = PURE(P.copy(p,n), v', x, t, g' e)
	 fun checkClicked(tok, n2, m, class, arithOp) = 
	   if cvtPreCondition(n, n2, x, v2) then
	     (click tok; class(arithOp(p,m), v', x2, t2, g' e2))
	   else skip()
       in
	 case a
	  of P.test(n2,m) =>
	     if m >= p then checkClicked("C5", n2, m, PURE, P.copy)
	     else checkClicked("C6", n2, m, ARITH, P.test)
	   | P.testu(n2,m) => 
	     if m >= p then checkClicked("C7", n2, m, PURE, P.copy)
	     else checkClicked("C8", n2, m, ARITH, P.testu)
	   | _ => skip()
       end

  I read this as: "a P.copy followed by a P.testu will remove the testu
  if the copy contains the size of the testu args (and some other stuff)."  
  I don't see why it's safe to remove an overflow check here.  What invariant 
  guarantees that this check gets done elsewhere?  
  Note that (p = n = n2 = m = 31) will remove the testu. 

  Before compiling a compiler that changes this (see my next sml-bugs message)
  to see if it's indeed the bug, perhaps the writer of this code would be
  so kind to check my reading of it.

  =======================
  [Lal] Well, the bug is really in the mips code generator.
  testu_31_31 is implemented in generic as:

	| ARITH(P.testu(31, 31), [v], x, _, e) => 
	      alloc(x,any,fn x' => let val vreg = gpregbind v
		    in
		      M.addt(vreg,gpregbind(INT32 0wx80000000), x');
		      M.move(vreg, x');
		      gen e
		    end)

  The M.addt traps on overflow and does the necessary range check. 

  If no overflow takes place, then the M.move copies the argument (vreg)
  into the result register x'. However, The implementation of M.move
  among other things has something like this:

    fun move(Direct a, Direct b) =
     (case (reg_rep a, reg_rep b) 
       of   ....
	| (Reg' a', Reg' b') => 
	       if a'=b' then () else emit(M.ADD(b,a,RegOp0)))
	    ....

  Now if vreg is identical to x', then the copy is _not_ performed!!
  Hence the bug.
						  QED.

  Well, then its in the other old code generators as well.
  Moreover, I don't think it's a CG bug...

  because what else should M.move do if the src and dst are the same?
  If it did the explicit move, that would have the same deleterious effect here.

  Are we certain that it's OK for generic to see a primop where the 
  args and the destination share a common lvar?  

  The question seems to be: why is testu(31,31) being passed an 
  arg (v) that maps to the same register as its destination.

  Again, how would you correctly _do_ the copy in the CG if dst == src?

  Indeed this is a bug. 
  The rules relating TESTU and COPY should be:

    TESTU(n,m) o COPY(p,n)	== COPY(p,m)   if (m > p)
				  == TESTU(p,m)  if (m <= p)

  in cps/generic.sml:

	  | ARITH(P.testu(32, 32), [v], x, _, e) => 
		alloc(x,any,fn x' => let val vreg = gpregbind v

	                   val vreg = gpregbind v
			   val lab = newlabel()
		         in
			   ibranch(LEU, vreg, gpregbind(INT32 0wx3fffffff), lab);
			   M.move(gpregbind(INT32 0wx80000000), x');
			   M.addt(x', x', x');
			   define lab;
			   M.add(vreg, vreg, x');
			   M.orb(immed 1, x', x');

	  | PURE(P.pure_arith{oper=P./,kind=P.UINT 32},[v,w],x,_,e) =>

			gen e))


  =====================
  [Lal]
  Actually there are more bugs of this kind lurking around particularly
  wrt to M.mult, M.mulu, and M.divtu. I'm amazed that we haven't tripped
  over them before. The fix for this is a little involved. There are two
  alternatives:

    1. Change M.divt (and others) to be 3-address instructions. This
       would mean changing the implementation in all the code generators.

    2. Gurantee at least two arithmetic temps. This may not be such 
       a big problem on RISC machines (although it would be a shame 
       to tie up a register this way), but would certainly hurt the
       x86.

  =====================
  [jhr]

    3. switch to the new back-end.

  =====================

  >Actually there are more bugs of this kind lurking around particularly

  The primops with M.mult, M.mulu, and M.divtu (other than the above)
  seem OK since they use arithtemp.  The problem occurs when there's a
  write to the alloc'd variable (x') before the last gpregbind of a variable
  since (as you pointed out) alloc is free to use the same register as 
  that assigned to another lvar as long as the last use appears in this
  expression.

Severity:       major
Problem:        large memory consumption
Code:           compiling the compiler
Comments:

When compiling the compiler for versions 109.24 and 109.25, the following
amounts of real and virtual memory are used:

		109.24 x86-win32	109.25 x86-win32

real:		101 MB			150 MB
virtual:	166 MB			199 MB

These numbers come via the NT performance monitor, which can gather,
among other things, per-process peak real and virtual memory usage.
The virtual-memory numbers are the number of virtual bytes reserved
by the process, but not necessarily allocated.

On mipseb-irix5, the process sizes grow to:

		109.24 mipseb-irix5	109.25 mipseb-irix5

"top"'s size:	139 MB			154 MB

The mipseb-irix5 numbers were obtained by staring, for the length of
the compile, at the output of "top," recording the largest value for 
the process "size" field, and multiplying by the OS's page size (4K).

Default compiler/runtime settings were used.

I'm sending this along as a major bug since it impedes coding as much, 
if not more, than an incorrect implementation of a compiler component 
(which often has a source-level work around).

[jhr] I think that this can be traced to the reformat phase (at least we have
some strong evidence of that).  I assume that Zhong is working on a fix.

Fix: [Zhong]
Enclosed please find a (temporary) fix for the "reformat" bug John 
mentioned above. The "crazy" space blowup can occur only if you are
compiling abstractions (with huge mutually recursive datatypes). In
the compiler, all the space blowup happens when compiling the
file profile/tell-env.sml. 

  basics/typesutil.sml
     Turn off the reformating on abstract data types. Reformating can
     potentially leads to exponential space and time blow up (BUG 1145).

[dbm]
This is a temporary fix.  A long term fix requires redesign of the
datatype representation.

Version: 109.25
System: -
Severity: major 
Problem: 
  If a type with an eqtype spec shares with a non-equality type
  in an opaque signature match, the first type looses its equality
  property.
Code:
  (* bug1152.1.sml *)
  structure A :> 
    sig
      eqtype t
    end =
  struct
    type t = int
  end;

  fun f(x: A.t) = x = x;  (* works *)
=========================

      sharing type t = B.t
    end =
  struct
    type t = int
    structure B = struct type t = t end
  end;

  fun f(x: A.t) = x = x;  (* should work, but doesn't *)

Comments:

  I ran the heap image you sent me under adb, and it looks like
  it might be a bug in the new representation analysis (not my
  part of the system :).  I will continue to look into the
  unexpected shutdown problem, which I suspect is unrelated.

  Zhong: there is a fairly repeatable SIGBUS error on the
  sparc in a big CML/eXene program.  The code being executed is:

	  bl      noGC
	  sub     %g1, -0xaf8, %i3
	  ld      [%sp+0x64], %o4
	  mov     %g1, %o7
	  jmp     %o4
	  mov     0x7f, %o5
  noGC:
	  ld      [%i0+0x4], %o1		// SIGBUS here
	  ld      [%o1], %i0
	  jmp     %i1
	  cmp     %g6,%g4

  The value of %i0 is 0xb6206fff, which is a tagged int/word.
  I ran this twice and got the same error (same register value)
  at the same address.

  This is not practical in this case.  The program in question is an
  eXene application.  It doesn't run very long before it core dumps
  (two menu operations).

Title: CM insists on recompiling sources in a stable library
Keywords: CM, cutoff recompilation
Submitter: Matthias Blume <blume@CS.Princeton.EDU> 
Date: 2/12/97
Version: 109.25
System: -
Severity: major 
Problem: 
  I just spent some time chasing a particularly persistent bug:
  Both Lal and John reported earlier that CM would insist on
  recompiling certain sources, despite the fact that the library they
  are in is stable and none of the sources were touched in between.

  However, after fixing a bug in my treatment of timestamps - something
  that I hoped would solve the problem - the effect did _not_ go away.
  I investigated further, and now it looks very much like a bug related
  to hashing and/or filtering of environments.

  Let me explain: The context for compiling or unpickling a given
  compilation unit is constructed by combining the delta environments
  obtained from compiling/unpickling its predecessors in the dependency
  graph.  Some of those predecessors may live in a group/library that
  has an export filter.  In this case the corresponding delta env is
  filtered first before it is used and its hash is (re)calculated for
  the purpose of compatibility checks.

  Unfortunately, for some reason the following property doesn't seem to
  hold in (at least) 109.25 (remember that pickling/hashing is always
  done relative to some context):

	  hash{env=c,context=empty) = hash(env=c',context=empty)
	      hash(env=e,context=c) = hash(env=e',context=c')
				  f = f'
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    hash(env=filter(e,f),context=c) = hash(env=filter(e',f'),context=c')

  In words:  Hashing the _same_ delta environment filtered by the _same_
  filter with respect to the _same_ context yields _different_ hash
  values.  And the effects are spurious recompilations...

  Environment gurus: Any ideas what's going on?

Comments:
 [Andrew]
  I don't know what's going on, but I will be happy to sit down with you
  and we can instrument the pickler to report what the difference
  is between one thing and the other, so that we can track it down.

 [Matthias, 2/13/97]
  The function Signature in pickle/pickmod.sml pickles boundeps, even
  though a comment says it doesn't.  Unfortunately, in what should be
  _exactly_ the same environment it sometimes is

	  ref NONE

  and at other times

	  ref (SOME <list>)

  Thus, the pickles and therefore the hash value come out differently.
  We once had the same problem with lty, and I went through some pretty
  ugly hackery to fix that.

  In general I would like to see all optional information that is
  redundant (not sure if boundeps is redundant) disappear completely
  from the pickled environments, because it only causes trouble there.

 [Zhong, 2/13/97]
  I was in charge of the "boundeps" stuff in Signature --- the "boundeps"
  itself is a hack, it should become standard (not an "option ref" anymore) 
  once the module instantiation is implementated incrementally.

  For the time being, you can turn off the pickling of the boundeps field
  completely. Would this fix your unnecessary recompilation problem ?

 [Matthias, 2/19/97]
  I have the sneaking suspicion that bugs 1106, 1135, and 1154 are
  really all the same bug or at least very closely related.

 [Zhong, 2/20/97]
  The "boundeps" field could be one cause for bug 1154, but
  it cannot be the cause for 1106 since signatures in 109.21
  do not even haven boundeps field.

Fix:
  [Zhong, 2/26/97]
  pickle/pickmod.sml
     Turn off the pickling on the boundeps field of the signatures. 
     If Matthias's analysis is right, this could fix BUG 1154. But
     I think there are other reasons to BUG 1154.

  Looks secondary to me too.  The problem is, *I* think the code is good,
  and the code compiles without any error at all under 109.23.  So
  either there's a primary error triggering all this, or else you've
  implemented another of those rules of SML '96 that I don't understand,
  in which case I'd be grateful if you'd explain to me where I've gone
  wrong.  As far as I understand, the compiler is complaining about
    type 'f field_binding'    = 'f * Exp.intexp
  not maching its definitional specification, even though the
  definitional specification appears identical...
 [dbm]
  Yes, definitely a bug.  The bug goes away if the call of G is expanded
  inline, and also if the substructure A is eliminated and t is defined
  in terms of a constant type (e.g. type t = int).
 [Zhong, 2/25/97]
  Norman's program is caused by a problem in Instantiation, more
  specifically,

    modules/instantiate.sml
      When instantiating DEFtyc and GENtyc, the old code does not create
      a new stamp, this is wrong because the tycon in signature would then
      have the same tycId as its instantiation tycon. This makes two different
      tycons map to the same binding in the modmaps, causing a bunch of 
      mysterious bugs.

  I'll send the fix to be included into 109.25.1.

  I can't simplify the code furthermore. My guess is that it 
  is caused by the same bug you and Lorenz have identified
  a few days ago, because:

  (1) If I change "val z = Word.toInt w" to "val z = Word.toIntX w"
      the bug goes away.

  (2) If I turn off cpsopt, the bug goes away. The bug seems to only
      occur for a particular sequence of word manipulation instructions
      (mostly likely caused by the same "move-with-same-src-and-tgt" problem)

 [Lal]
  Yes. You are right.

  I ran the same test case in my version of 109.25 that contained that

  Thanks for the bug report. The bug is caused by the incorrect

  Just curious, since pre-109.24 won't accept code like above, did you
  write these code recently ? FoxNet seems to be one of those applications 
  that really require matching concrete datatype reps against abstract
  datatype reps.

  It seems that certain internal types (word8, word32, int32) are leaking
  out into the pervasive environment.  This is cased by the "open PrimTypes"
  in boot/bind-toplevel.sml.  We should replace it with rebindings of the
  top-level types.

Comments:
    The infrastructure to fix this already exists in bind-toplevel.sml.
    The bug is caused by PrimTypes being opened.

Fix:
    Once we can say:
	datatype 'a ref = datatype PrimTypes.ref
   
    the line that opens PrimTypes can be removed.

 [jhr, 8/26/97]
  I did this by replacing the opening of PrimTypes in boot/bind-toplevel.sml
  with

	  datatype ref = PrimTypes.ref

  The special properties of references (equality, etc.) still seem to hold.

Keywords: file access time, Win32
Submitter: Andrew Stevens <Andrew.Stevens@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

Version: 109.25
System: x86-Win32
Severity: major
Problem: 
  The OS.FileIO.modTime function and the underlying Win32.FileIO.getFileTime' 
  functions appear not to be accessing the correct time-stamp.   The returned 
  timestamp never changes when a file is written to (e.g. by editting and 
  saving).  
Comments:

  Thanks for the report.  The runtime was querying for creation time, 
  not access time; this is fixed for the next version.

  > in TextIO.setPosIn(ins,TextIO.getPosIn ins) ;
  >   TextIO.closeIn ins

  uncaught exception Io: filePosIn failed on "foo" with exception Fail: bogus position
    raised at: boot/NewIO/text-io-fn.sml:132.14-132.56

Comments:
  I ran strace to see what was going on.  Here is the snippet of the
  relevant part of the strace output.

  > open("foo", O_RDONLY)                   = 4
  > fstat(4, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=23, ...}) = 0
  > lseek(4, 0, SEEK_CUR)                   = 0
  > read(4, "foo is a nonempty file\n", 4096) = 23
  > lseek(4, 23, SEEK_SET)                  = 23
  > read(4, "", 1)                          = 0
  > getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF, {ru_utime={1, 430000}, ru_stime={0, 390000}, ...}) = 0
  > write(1, "\nuncaught exception Io: filePos"..., 86) = 86
  > write(1, "  raised at: boot/NewIO/text-io-"..., 53) = 53

  The problem is that the position returned by the call to getPosIn is
  wrong - it should be 1, but it appears to be 23 + 1 (as evidenced by
  the second lseek followed by the read).  Looking at the source code
  (boot/NewIO/text-io-fn.sml), it looks like the function extendStream
  on line 139 is broken.  In particular, the basePos for the new buffer
  is wrong, since it is computed *after* the read of the buffer, and
  hence points after the end, rather than at the beginning of the new
  buffer.

  Printing polymorphic records is still not correct. For example,
      val x = (3, fn _ => 4) would cause boxity errors in ppobj. 
  Fully supporting this requires major changes in ppobj, so I temporarily
  turned off the pretty-printing for polymorphic records
 [Zhong, 4/9/97]
  Temporary hack prints "polymorphic record" as a stand-in.  True
  fix requires extensive rewrite of PPVal.

  The program below has no floating point but generates :

  v764(v996[PV],v995[PV],v994[C],v993[PV],v992[PV],v991[PV],v990[PV]) =
     {(I)0,v990} -> v601
     v995.1 -> v997[I]
     if i31=(v997,(I)6) [v603] then
	funwrap((I)0) -> v604[R]
	funwrap(v990) -> v605[R]
	{RK_FBLOCK 2,v604,v605} -> v606
	v994(v994,v993,v992,v991,v606)
     else
	v994(v994,v993,v992,v991,v601)

  What's even more weird is that it is trying to unwrap the integer
  constant zero into a floating point value:

	funwrap((I)0) -> v604[R]

 [dbm, 3/26/97]
  Works in 109.25 (on sparc-solaris), but fails in 109.25.1, so probably
  do to a diff between 109.25 and 109.25.1.  Likely candidates are 
  cps or translate.
 [Zhong, 3/26/97
  These are actually dead code. Representation analysis insert wrappers 
  (using typecase) in the front end; the CPS optimizer is not good enough
  to eliminate these dead code, but it does do some partial constant 
  propagations. This leads to strange code such as 

	funwrap ((I) 0) -> v604[R]

  And I am sure the code generator will complain, thus the bug. 
      > 
      > uncaught exception RegMap

  This kind of scenerio happens before, I think we still allow
  CPS code such as SELECT((I) 0, 0).

Title: bug in blastRead, blastWrite?
Keywords: blastRead, blastWrite
Submitter: Chris Paris <cap@cmu.edu>
Date: 3/20/97
Version: 109.25.2, 109.23, 109.19
System: ?
Severity: major 
Problem: 
  I've been using the SML/NJ blast read and write primitives to store
  and retrieve a complex data structure in a program I'm working
  on. This technique has been working fine for over a year. Recently,
  the program has been breaking in strange ways, and I wonder if perhaps
  the blast read/write primitives have not kept up with the other work
  on the compiler. I've not yet been successful in coming up with a
  short example program that demonstrates that the problem is with an
  SML/NJ primitive, but I thought I'd ask at this point, in case you
  know for sure that there's a problem. I've been having these problems
  with 109.25.2, 109.23, and 109.19. The problem exhibits itself
  slightly differently in each of those versions.

  I'm curious about whether anyone else is using the blast read/write
  primitives in their work, and also I'd like to know why these
  facilities were devised in the first place. Was it for a specific
  project?

Code:

 [jhr, 3/25/97]
  As far as I know, there is no reason that blast read/write should
  be broken, but it is possible.  What version did it last work in?
  One way to test this would be to blast in a value after you blast it
  out, and make sure it hasn't changed.

 [Chris Paris, 3/25/97]
  To provide a little context here, our application is a single server
  application that provides UNIX system administration functionality for
  all of the machines in CMU SCS. There is a single SML process on one
  machine, which accepts connections from clients on the network.
  That's a vast oversimplification (makes it sound like a bunch of perl
  scripts), but at least it indicates what I'm working on. The size of
  the SML part of the project is a bit over 13,000 lines.

  We've been running our "production version" code on 109.19 for quite a
  while, and it has "seemed" to work. There is the occasional crash or
  weird behavior, which I've previously attributed to possible bugs in
  our SML code, or other bugs in the compiler or runtime system.  Our
  newer code is bigger and more complex, and it fails readily on 109.19
  and anything after that (it fails in a different way with each version
  of the compiler). (And no, I'm not trying to blastRead an object
  written with a different compiler.)

  I'm using blast read/write to store a sort of database. It gets read
  into memory, just once, at startup time, and periodically written out
  in a single blast operation. If the write/read pair were to
  dramatically corrupt the data, then I should expect the overall system
  to fail rather quickly. But if only a few things are messed up, it's
  conceivable that the system would give the impression that everything
  is okay, at least for a time. That's somewhat hard for me to believe,
  but the evidence suggests that that's what's happening.

  I can initialize my "database" from scratch by running some scripts,
  rather than by loading a previously blasted SML runtime value. For a
  few days now I've been running a system that is fully functional
  except that it does no blast read/write operations. We've been unable
  to make this one crash.

  The trouble is, any small test I've performed with the blast
  functions, such as writing out a simpler data structure that I can
  easily verify after reading it back, indicates that the blast
  functions are working fine. Until I can come up with a clear sample
  that causes the blast functions to fail, the best I can say is that
  our whole program appears to work if we don't use it and fails in
  subtle ways if we do use it.

  The obvious risk with using the blast functions is a type mismatch
  between the reading and the writing side, since it's completely up to
  the programmer to get it right. But I think if I were getting the
  types wrong, it would fail immediately. Besides, I have the code
  structured to avoid that possibility. E.g.,

  type db = ...
  fun read_it () : db = ... blastRead ...
  fun write_it (obj : db) = ... blastWrite ...

Title: tmp argument naming in front end
Keywords: absyn
Submitter: Manual Fahndrich <manuel@cs.berkeley.edu>
Date: March 29/97
Version: 109.26
System: x86/Unix
Severity: low
Problem: The function FUNdec in elabutil.sml introduces new temporary
         names for function arguments. Unfortunately, all arguments
	 are called the same, namely "arg". This makes it
	 extremely inconvenient to use the frontend for other compiler
	 work, since the lexical structure is not preserved by the
	 nameing.
Code:
Parse the function:

- fun h x = h x

You get:

val g =
      let val g =
                (fn arg =>
                      (fn arg =>
                            (case (arg,arg)
                              of (h,x) => h (x))))
       in g
      end

Printed using ppDec. The 2nd "arg" shadows the first, if one goes by
identifier names.

Comments:
  I've cut down the problem from a couple thousand lines of code
  across several modules to the 250 lines here. Taking out much
  more makes the problem go away. 

  In the MilC structure, changing either the definition of eqmember
  or map2 to the (trivial) commented out versions is sufficient to
  get the compiler to terminate. Unfortunately, these definitions
  are not quite what I need.

  This error message is complaining about a type variable that is
  not generalized anywhere. This could be caused by placing the
  wrong value into the "boundtvs" field in the VALdec (VB {...})
  in absyn (during typechecking).

  The code above shows that it might be related to the tyvar of 
  "flex-record", i.e., the type for variable "a" above.

Version:     109.25.2, 109.26
System:      alpha-osf1v3.2c
Severity:    major
Problem:     

A loop which should run in constant space causes the virtual
storage required by the program to grow with no apparent bound.

Code:        

structure Leak =
 struct
  local

   type T = {field: unit}

   val data = {field = ()}

   fun monitor n = 
        if (n mod 10000 = 1) then
	 (print "starting garbage collection...";
	  SMLofNJ.Internals.GC.doGC 0;
	  SMLofNJ.Internals.GC.doGC 0;
	  print " done\n")
	else
	 ()

   val handlers = ref ((fn _ => ()): T -> unit)
  in
   fun run n : unit =
        (handlers := ! handlers; (* comment this line out for no leak *)
	 (! handlers) data;   (* comment this line out for much faster leak *)
	 monitor n;
	 run (n + 1))

  end
 end

Transcript:  <transcript of exectution demonstating the bug>

  Leak.run 0;

Comments:

We measured virtual memory size by using the following shell script,
which records the size of the ML process at approximately 5-second
intervals.  (It assumes there is only one such process running on the
machine).

#! /bin/csh -f
set f = ./sizes
touch $f
while (1)
	set x = `ps auxwww | fgrep run | fgrep -v grep | awk '{print $5}' | tr MK '  ' | sort -n -r | head -1`
        echo $x
        echo $x >> $f
	sleep 5
end

The leak should start to become visible within several minutes.  The
rate of increase slows somewhat as time passes, but the space usage
does not appear to level off.

The code does double garbage collections because John Reppy indicated
this as a workaround for a previously-reported memory leak (having
to do with array allocation).

In tests with a more complicated piece of code from which the
above was derived, changing the type T (to unit, for example) 
caused the space leak to vanish.

A hypothesis consistent with the facts is that

     handlers := ! handlers;

adds some sort of boxing/unboxing wrapper to the function stored in
the ref cell.  This would explain why omitting the application of this
function causes the program (and the leak) to go significantly faster
and why removing the assignment or changing the type T could fix the
leak.

Comment:
 [Lorenz, 5/20/97]
  The memory leak in the presence of function refs seems to have
  been properly diagnosed by its submitter; i.e. wrapper records
  are being continually chained around the ref's value.  

  The following source and cps (for f) illustrates:

  bug:
     type T = int*int
     val handlers = ref ((fn _ => ()): T -> unit);
     fun f _ : unit =
	 (handlers := !handlers;
	  f ());

  ****starting genfrag KNOWNCHK **** 
  v696(v741[I],v740[PV]) =
     !(v740) -> v625[F]
     {RK_ESCAPE 2,(L)v697,v625} -> v698
     boxedupdate(v740,(I)0,v698)
     !(v740) -> v670[F]
     {RK_ESCAPE 2,(L)v705,v670} -> v706
     boxedupdate(v740,(I)0,v706)
     !(v740) -> v674[F]
     {RK_ESCAPE 2,(L)v713,v674} -> v714
     boxedupdate(v740,(I)0,v714)
     !(v740) -> v678[F]
     {RK_ESCAPE 2,(L)v721,v678} -> v722
     boxedupdate(v740,(I)0,v722)
     (L)v696((I)0,v740)
  (* wrapper functions deleted *)


  nobug:
     type T = int;
     val handlers = ref ((fn _ => ()): T -> unit);
     fun f _ : unit =
	 (handlers := !handlers;
	  f ());

     !(v958) -> v929[F]
     boxedupdate(v958,(I)0,v929)
     !(v958) -> v930[F]

     boxedupdate(v958,(I)0,v931)
     (L)v946((I)0,v958)

 [Zhong, 5/21/97]
  Thanks for diagnosing it for me, Lorenz. I didn't read the comments
  section of their bug report. 

  Yes, when we do "handlers := !handlers", a pair of wrap and unwrap
  operations are inserted, they should ultimately cancel out from 
  each other, but occasionally, the eta-reduction code in cpsopt
  leave some eta-redexes un-reduced --- causing a trivial closure 
  being built each time. 

  Your above code actually works ok in pre-109.28 (because of more aggressive
  front-end optimizations), though the code in the original bug report
  still does not work quite right. I'll look into it and fix it in 109.28.

 [Zhong, 8/15/97]
  I modified the CPS optimizer to be more aggressive on reducing the eta
  redex. This fixes the bug 1193 --- but ideally, I should do a fix that
  can guaranttee the following:

     For any ref cell x of type "\tau ref",  the expression "x := !x"
     should not introduce extra heap allocations.

  The new CPS optimizer will handle most of type \tau, but I can't
  prove that it can make such guaranttee.

  I have some idea how the "ideal" fix should be like. For the time being,
  I'd suggest that we add the above comments to bug 1193, still leave it 
  as open, but down-grade its priority to Medium.

Problem: 
  1. Type sharing is not propagated.  If I instantiate Interp with a structure
  AbSyn, then invoke Interp.evaluate on something from AbSyn, I get a type
  error in the second case, but not the first.  The problem remains if I
  extend the "where type" list to stipulate equality of all types in the
  signature.

  2. When instantiating Interp in the second form, I get:

  - structure Interp = Interp (structure A = AbSyn);

Problem: exportFn image sizes have grown since 108.
Code: 
  (* 108: *)

  structure Test = 
  struct

  fun dummy(_,[name]) = 
      (print ("Hi I am "^name^"\n"))

  fun export() = 
      exportFn("/step/sml-108/bin/.heap/hi",dummy)

  end


  (* 109.27 *)

  structure Test = 
  struct

  fun dummy(name,_) = 
      (TextIO.print ("Hi I am "^name^"\n");
       OS.Process.success)

  fun export() = 
      SMLofNJ.exportFn("/step/sml/bin/.heap/hi",dummy)

  end

Comments:
  The sizes of the exported images were:

  108:
  -rw-rw----   1 nikolaj    196292 May  1 22:42 hi

  109.27
  -rw-rw----   1 nikolaj    500824 May  1 22:38 hi.sparc-solaris

  For larger executables the situation gets even worse. I 
  reported an image size of more than 35 MB in 109.27 compared
  to approx 13 MB in 108.

  This difference seems to be caused from changes in the runtime
  system, as even the image for a null function is about this 
  big. 

     fun export1() = SMLofNJ.exportFn("xxx1", dummy);
     fun export2() = SMLofNJ.exportFn("xxx2", fn _ => 0);

  -rw-r--r--   1 shao     systems   449616 May  2 09:38 xxx1.sparc-solaris
  -rw-r--r--   1 shao     systems   433232 May  2 10:55 xxx2.sparc-solaris

  I also checked the runtime closures for both the dummy function and
  the "fn _ => 0" function, they all contain minimum amount of 
  free variables.

  This could be caused by completely different reasons from the previous.
  Sorry for keeping asking this, but if you can ship us the entire 
  source code, we can probably take a look and narrow the problem down
  for you.

Title: where type problem, rhs within current signature

Severity: major 
Problem: 
  A functor using a definitional type spec in the parameter signature
  works, while an equivalent version using "where type" fails with 
  uncaught exception Unbound.
Code:
  signature S = sig
    type t
  end;

  functor F1(structure X : S
	     structure Y : sig type t = X.t
			   end) =
  struct
    val x = 1
  end;

  functor F2(structure X : S
	     structure Y : S where type t = X.t) =
  struct
    val x = 1
  end;

Comments:
Fix: In finalize in explore_tclass, when there is an "external" (i.e.
  where clause) definition, characterize it as NINST instead of INST,
  and remove the call to simplify (so that instToTyc will deal with
  it properly.
