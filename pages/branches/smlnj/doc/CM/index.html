<h1>The SML/NJ Compilation Manager (CM)</h1>
There are two different versions of the compilation manager.<br>
<ol>
  <li>The <a href="Old/index.html"> old version</a>
      (<a href="old.ps">.ps</a>) that is still used in the official
      release version of SML/NJ.</li>
  <li>A <a href="New/index.html">new version</a>
      (<a href="new.ps">.ps</a>) that has been substantially revised,
      was rewritten from scratch, and for some time now (since version
      110.20) has been included with working versions of SML/NJ.</li>
</ol>
<br>
There is also some documentation for the (new)
<a href="btcomp/index.html">bootstrap compiler</a>
(<a href="btcomp.ps">.ps</a>).
