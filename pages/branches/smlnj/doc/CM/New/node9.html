2.6 Library components (groups)
</H2>

<P>
CM's group model eliminates a whole class of potential naming problems
by providing control over name spaces for program linkage.  The group
model in full generality sometimes requires bindings to be renamed at
the time of import. As has been described
separately&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node110.html#blume:appel:cm99">BA99</A>], in the case of ML this can also be
achieved using ``administative'' libaries, which is why CM can get
away with not providing more direct support for renaming.

<P>
However, under CM, the term ``library'' does not only mean namespace
management (as it would from the point of view of the pure group
model) but also refers to actual file system objects (e.g., CM
description files and stable library files).  It would be inconvenient
if name resolution problems would result in a proliferation of
additional library files.  Therefore, CM also provides the notion of
library components (``groups'').  Name resolution for groups works
like name resolution for entire libraries, but grouping is entirely
internal to each library.

<P>
When a library is <EM> stabilized</EM> (via <TT> CM.stabilize</TT> - see
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node11.html#sec:stable">2.8</A>), the entire library is compiled to a single
file (hence groups do not result in separate stable files).

<P>
During development, each group has its own description file which will
be referred to by the surrounding library or by other groups of that
library. The syntax of group description files is the same as that of
library description files with the following exceptions:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The initial keyword <TT> Library</TT> is replaced with <TT> Group</TT>.
It is followed by the name of the surrounding library's description
file in parentheses.</LI>
<LI>The export list can be left empty, in which case CM will provide
a default export list: all exports from ML source files plus all
exports from subcomponents of the component.  Imports from other
libraries will not be re-exported in this case.  (Notice that an
export list that is not <EM> syntactically</EM> empty but which
effectively contains zero symbols because of conditional
compilation--see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node55.html#sec:preproc">7</A>--does not count as being
``left empty'' in the above sense.  Instead, the result would be an
almost certainly useless component with truly no exports.)</LI>
<LI>There are some small restrictions on access control
specifications (see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node59.html#sec:access">8</A>).</LI>
</UL>

<P>
As an example, let us assume that
<TT> foo-utils.cm</TT> contains the following text:

<P>
 
<PRE>

  Group (foo-lib.cm)
  is
      set-util.sml
      map-util.sml
      $/basis.cm
</PRE>

<P>
This description defines group <TT> foo-utils.cm</TT> to have the
following properties:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>it is a component of library <TT> foo-lib.cm</TT> (meaning that only
foo-lib.cm itself or other groups thereof may list <TT> foo-utils.cm</TT> as one
of their members)</LI>
<LI><TT> set-utils.sml</TT> and <TT> map-util.sml</TT> are ML source files
belonging to this component</LI>
<LI>exports from the Standard Basis Library are available when
compiling these ML source files</LI>
<LI>since the export list has been left blank, the only (implicitly
specified) exports of this component are the top-level definitions in
its ML source files</LI>
</UL>

<P>
With this, the library description file <TT> foo-lib.cm</TT> could list
<TT> foo-utils.cm</TT> as one of its members:

<P>
 
<PRE>

  Library
      signature FOO
      structure Foo
  is
      foo.sig
      foo.sml
      foo-utils.cm
      $/basis.cm
</PRE>

<P>
No harm is done if <TT> foo-lib.cm</TT> does not actually mention <TT> 
foo-utils.cm</TT>.  In this case it could be that
<BR> <TT> 
foo-utils.cm</TT> is mentioned indirectly via a chain of other components
of <TT> foo-lib.cm</TT>.  The other possibility is that it is not
mentioned at all (in which case CM would never know about it, so it
cannot complain).
