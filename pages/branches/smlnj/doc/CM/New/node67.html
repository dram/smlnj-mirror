11.2.1 Filename abstractions</A>
</H3>

<P>
CM represents filenames as something that could be called a <EM> 
filename closure</EM>.  Essentially, what this means is that not only a
string is being remembered but also the context in which to interpret
the string.  For a relative path, context information is the directory
in which it is to be interpreted; for an anchored path, the context
takes care of the anchoring.

<P>
The <TT> Tools</TT> module provides two abstract types related to this
filename abstraction:

<P>
 
<PRE>

  type presrcpath
  type srcpath
</PRE>

<P>
Since many tools invoke external shell commands or perform other
operation on physical files, it is often necessary to obtain an actual
native filename string from an abstract path:

<P>
 
<PRE>

  val nativeSpec : srcpath -&gt; string
  val nativePreSpec : presrcpath -&gt; string
</PRE>

<P>
It is important to remember that these two functions frequently return
relative filenames, and such relative names must be interpreted from
within the right directory.  This ``right'' directory is the directory
that contains the CM description file on whose behalf the tool's rule
was invoked.  Rules that perform physical operations on files whose
names result from <TT> nativeSpec</TT> or <TT> nativePreSpec</TT> must
therefore first switch to that directory.  See the discussion of the
<TT> context</TT> argument to rule functions below.

<P>
Strings that can potentially be used as pathnames are being passed
around as records containing a <TT> name</TT>- and a <TT> mkpath</TT> field.
The <TT> name</TT> field contains the string itself while <TT> mkpath</TT>
is a ``suspended'' abstract version of the path.

<P>
A fresh pathmaker can be constructed from native strings using <TT> 
native2pathmaker</TT>, which like <TT> context</TT> is also an argument to
rule functions.  This function takes care of interpreting relative
strings within the correct context.  (For this, it is not even
necessary to first switch the current working directory.)

<P>
Recall that filenames that appear in description files can be written
using either ``standard'' or ``native'' syntax.  The field <TT> name</TT>
will, thus, contain a string that can be in either of these two forms.
However, CM will pass an <TT> mkpath</TT> function that accounts for these
syntactic differences and which also takes care of interpreting the
string in the correct context.

<P>
When new name specifications are constructed by the tool, the
appropriate <TT> mkpath</TT> function must be provided.  For most tools
this will be a value constructed by applying <TT> native2pathmaker</TT> to
some native filename string (because most tools internally operate on
native paths).

<P>
As shown above, there are two abstract path types: <TT> presrcpath</TT>
and <TT> srcpath</TT>.  The former can represent both directory names and
source file names, the latter can represent only source file names.
To convert from <TT> presrcpath</TT> to <TT> srcpath</TT>, use function <TT> 
Tools.srcpath</TT>:
<PRE>

  val srcpath : presrcpath -&gt; srcpath
</PRE>
This function enforces CM's rule that there has to be at least one arc
in every such name (i.e., that it cannot be just an anchor).

<P>
One can also construct a new abstract path from an existing path by
adding arcs at the end.  The constructed path will share its internal
context with the old one.

<P>
 
<PRE>

  val augment : presrcpath -&gt; string list -&gt; presrcpath
</PRE>

<P>
The list of strings must contain simple pathname arcs.
