    <h1>ckit</h1>
<strong>ckit</strong> is a C front end written in SML that translates
C source code (after preprocessing) into abstract syntax represented
as a set of SML datatypes.  It also provides facilities for extending
the C language with additional syntactic constructs, which can be useful
for implementing "C-like" domain-specific languages as well as C dialects.

Ckit is currently used as the front end for a variety of tools for
static analysis of C code and at least one domain-specific language.

Documentation is still rudimentary at this point.  There is an <A
HREF="overview.html">overview</A> (file doc/overview.html) explaining
how to get started, and the signatures of the major components are
commented.

The ckit software is available at:

<h3>Status</h3>
We have just released version 1.0 (31 March 2000).
<p>
Ckit has been used extensively to parse large code bases.  While the
parser is very stable, the type checker has been less thoroughly
tested.  Known open bugs can be found in the file BUGS.  A record
of previously fixed bugs is at the end of the file HISTORY.

<h3>Credits and History</h3>
<p>
David Ladd of Bell Labs in Naperville wrote a prototype C parser using
ML-Lex and ML-Yacc in the early 90s which was used by Daniel Jackson
and Gene Rollins at CMU for use in a program slicing tool (ChopShop,
1994).
<p>
Starting in late 1997, Satish Chandra (Bell Labs, Naperville) and
Michael Siff (University of Wisconsin-Madison) extensively rewrote the
parser and fixed numerous scoping problems, making it possible to
parse the SPEC benchmarks and large industrial code bases.  They also
developed ML types for representing abstract syntax trees and C types
and a translator from parse trees to abstract syntax.  They used this
infrastructure in various program analysis tools.
<p>
Starting in April 1998, Nevin Heintze and Dino Oliva (Bell Labs,
Murray Hill), later joined by Dave MacQueen and with continuing
assistance from Satish Chandra, turned this tool into a full-fledged
extensible frontend, adding a type checker, pretty-printer, and syntax
extension mechanisms as well as rewriting the parser to support error
recovery.  This effort lead to the current ckit, which has been used
to process multi-million line industrial code bases.
