<P>
The following table lists the combinations of architectures and
operating systems that are supported by SML/NJ 110 and later versions.
Operating systems with question marks may work, but we are not in a
position to test these.

<p>
<a name="windows"></a>
<dt><b>Windows? DOS?</b>
<dd>
SML/NJ version 110 works under Windows 95 and Windows NT.
For more information, see the <A HREF="windows.html">Windows FAQ page</A>.
<p>
<a name="Macintosh"></a>
<dt><b>What about Macintoshes?</b>
<dd>
A new port to Mac OS on PowerPC is planned, using runtime++ (aka the
"new new runtime").  We also expect to support <A
HREF="http://www.be.com/">BeOS</A> on the PowerPC (and maybe on Intel
too).  In the longer term, we hope it will be relatively easy to port
to MacOS X Server (aka Rhapsody), the new NeXTstep based OS for the
Mac, and LinuxPPC on the Mac.
<p>
<a name="others"></a>
<dt><b>What about other ports?</b>
<dd>
<p>
As indicated by this table, native code generators are available and
currently maintained for x86, Sun Sparc, DEC Alpha, PowerPC and
RS/6000, HPPA, and MIPS (big endian).  It is fairly straitforward to
do a port for a new flavor of Unix on one of these supported
architectures, and it should be easy to get SML/NJ to run under
Windows NT on Alphas.  In the past, SML/NJ has run under NeXTstep on
several architectures, and under DEC Ultrix on MIPS R3000 processors
(little endian), and on M680x0 based Sun workstations.
</P>
<p>
We are only in a position to support ports on platforms we have
access to, but we welcome volunteers who are willing to perform or
maintain ports on other platforms.
