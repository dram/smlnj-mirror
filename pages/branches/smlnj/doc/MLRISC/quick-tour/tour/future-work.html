      <dt> <b>Detailed user manual:</b><dd>
	   A detailed user manual describing the interfaces, algorithms, 
	   and examples on how to put together code generators.

      <p><dt> <b>x86 code generator:</b> <dd>The x86 poses several
      challenges which can be met quite effectively, I believe, by the
      register allocation technology used in MLRISC.

     <p><dt><b>Support for GC:</b> <dd> There is a strong interaction
     with support for GC and global code motion. MLRISC aims at
     providing a generic framework for code generators, and finding
     the right level of information to support GC and global code
     motion is an issue. I think we have several solutions to address
     this that need more evaluation.

     <p><dt><b>Other architectures:</b><dd> There is the need to port
to other architectures like the MIPS and SPARC.

      <dt><b> Predicated VLIW: </b><dd> Currently, there are no optimizations
that will support predication. In principle there is no reason why this
should be the case.


      <p><dt><b> Other compilers: </b><dd> I would really like to see some
major compiler effort bootstrapped with an MLRISC backend.

      <p><dt><b> Robustness of scheduling</b><dd>It is extremely difficult to
debug errors in modules that perform aggressive code
reorganizations. Ideas from formal methods such as typed assembly
language (TAL) or Proof Carrying Code (PCC) are worth investigating.
