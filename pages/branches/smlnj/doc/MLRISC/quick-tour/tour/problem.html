   </CENTER>

    Writing a 
    native code generator for any language is a signifcant
    investment especially for todays modern processors with a high
    degree of instruction level parallelism. The algorithms that must
    be used to generate high quality code are complex, sometimes quite
    delicate, and require substantial infrastructure.

    <P>

    <img alt="Retargeting compiler" align=right
    src=pictures/jpeg/uncol2.jpg> A specific architecture has a
    relatively short life time in relation to the time taken to build
    the code generator, and one quickly needs the ability to retarget
    to new versions of the architecture, or to different target
    architectures. This is by no means an open problem. There are many
    compilers today that target multiple architectures, however the
    quality of code varies. For example, <FONT
    COLOR=red><I>lcc</I></FONT> by Chris Fraser and David Hansen does
    no back end optimizations; <FONT COLOR=red><I>gcc</I></FONT> from
    the Free Software Foundation does extensive peephole and simple
    data flow optimizations, and falls short on advanced superscalar
    optimizations; and finally the <FONT COLOR=red><I>impact</I></FONT>
    compiler done by the Impact group at the
    University of Illinois specializes in more advanced superscalar
    and predicated architectures. 

    <BR CLEAR=right>

    <p>
    <img alt="UNCOL?" align=left src=pictures/jpeg/uncol.jpg> Assuming
    the retargeting issue is solved, one would like to use all the
    developed infrastructure for multiple source languages. This
    problem is far from solved; even though <I>gcc</I> has been used
    for multiple languages like Ada, Pascal, and Modula III, each of
    these have similiar execution models or were forced to adopt C
    conventions.  <I>gcc</I> cannot be used directly for languages
    such as Lisp, Smalltalk, Haskell, or ML that have radically
    different execution models and special requirements to support
    advanced language features.
