   _      end of 	New runtime
	  summer

   -	  1 week	Polling Support:
			MacOS (in particular) requires 
			polling support to handle signals.

 110.19  2 weeks	MLRISC: Major changes to MLTREE
 	done 7/8
			  o variable width support:
		  	  All operators will be register-size
			  sensitive. This is critical for machine
			  that support both 32 and 64 bits, and
			  machines that do not have powers-of-two
			  sized registers. It also turns out to
			  be essential for the C-- backend for lcc.
			
			  o use of infinite precision for immediates
	
			  o removal of order of evaluation field
			  that is currently part of many of the operators. 

			  o An escape hatch to inject machine assembly 
			    code into MLTrees. 

			  o A frameword to annotate instructions with
			  user information.

			  o and much more ...

   -      2 weeks 	New x86 technology:
			I want to experiment with two things:
			1) linear-scan register allocation, a la 
			   traub, holloway, and smith. This ought
			   to be fast and produce reasonable code.

			2) Transparency control, via integer linear
			   programming. There is not enough space in
			   this margin to describe this;-)

   -   	  2 weeks	Machine descriptions:
			Most machine specific MLRISC files are 
			current generated from machine descriptions.
			This version will have support to generate
			all necessary files from machine descriptions.
