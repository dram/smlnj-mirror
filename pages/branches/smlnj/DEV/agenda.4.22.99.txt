Agenda for 4/22/99 visit by Zhong Shao and Stefan Monnier

* status and roadmap for Flint
  - SML/NJ specific, we are working on the following:
     = cross-functor inlining and other FLINT optimizations
     = moving closure conversion into FLINT
     = primop and primtyc reorganizations (merging FLINT/CPS primops)
     = eliminating CPS completely (FLINT will go directly to MLtree) 
     = dictionary-based type-dependent operations (new pretty-printing
       support, elimination of runtime equality operator, etc.)
  - General to FLINT:
     = java bytecode to FLINT translation
     = stack-heap interoperability
     = new FLINT-based virtual machine and runtime system
     = front-end for a FLINT-like surface language

* status and roadmap for MLRISC
  - x86 plans
  - machine descriptions and mips
  - support for LCC to C--
  - machine SSA optimizations.

* status and roadmap for new runtime
  - architecture
  - interaction of changes with MLRISC and FLINT	
  - datatypes layout guarantees
  - idl, c-interface, COM

* design issues
  - exposing the new array representation in the compiler internals (and
    possibly in the PrimTypes interface too).
  - replacing Core with a dynamic mechanism.

* performance 
  - benchmarking
  - performance tracking
  - priorities for improving performance

* documentation
  - external
  - internal

* bug status
   (I'll bring the bug list up to date)

* plan for next release
