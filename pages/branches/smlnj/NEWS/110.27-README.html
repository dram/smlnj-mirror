<center><h2>Summary:</h2></center>
<UL>
<LI> <strong>WARNING</strong>: 110.27 has a fairly severe memory usage bug.
   The problem has been fixed and the fix will be available soon
   in Version 110.28.
<p>
<LI> This version has some minor tweeks to FLINT (after the major merge
   in 110.26).  Work continues on tuning FLINT and the various optimizations
   it implements.
<p>
<LI> CM has been revised extensively, and the modmap environment mechanism
   supporting stubbified pickles has been reworked completely.  The pathconfig
   file has been simplified.  Installation scripts have been further
   modified.  See src/system/README and the latest version of the
   CM manual at 
<blockquote>
    <//http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~blume/SMLNJ-DEV/manual/index.html>
    <//http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~blume/SMLNJ-DEV/manual.ps>
</blockquote>
   for further information about these changes.
<p>
<li> MRISC, and particularly the x86 back end have been modified extensively.
<p>
<li> There are a few updates to the SML/NJ Library
<p>
<li> Reported bug fixes:<br>
     1556. (jhr) signal race condition<br>
     Some CM bugs (not recorded)
<p>
<li> Distribution file names have been simplified.  They no longer start
   with the version number (e.g. "110.27-config.tar.gz" is now
   simply "config.tar.gz").  The boot directory tarballs are now
   "boot.alpha32-unix.tar.gz", etc. (i.e. no version number and the
   "sml." prefix is dropped).  The new install script will restore
   the usual name (e.g. "sml.boot.alpha32-unix" when the tarball is
   unpacked.  [We dropped the initial "sml." for the boot tarballs to
   get the file names under 28 characters because of a limitation of
   the Bell Labs ftp server.]
   The version README file is still named 110.27-README, however.

<h2> Change Details </h2>
<center><h3> FLINT </h3></center>
Improved handling of branches (mostly those generated from
polymorphic equality), removed switchoff and changed the
default optimization settings (more cpsopt and less flintopt).

<hr>
<center><h3> MLRISC </h3></center>
<ol>
<li> Register Allocator
<ol type="a">
<li> The interface and implementation of the register allocator have been 
changed slightly to accommodate the possibility of skipping 
the register allocation phases completely and go directly to 
memory allocation.  This is needed for C-- use.
<li> I've improved the spill propagation algorithm, using an approximation
of maximal weighted independent sets. This affects only the x86
platform. 
</ol>
<p>
<li> MLTREE
<ol type="a">
<li> Renamed the constructor CALL in MLTREE by popular demand.
</ol>
<p>
<li> X86
<ol type="a">
<li> More assembly output problems involving the indexed addressing mode
on the x86 have been found and corrected. Thanks to Fermin Reig for the
fix.
<li> x86Rewrite bug with MUL3 (found by Lal)
<li> Added the instructions FSTS, FSTL
<li> The old code generated for SETcc was completely wrong.  
The Intel optimization guide is VERY misleading.
<li> Various fixes related floating point, and extensions.
<li> Things like
<pre>
       jmp %eax
       jmp (%eax)
</pre>
are now output as
<pre>
       jmp *%eax
       jmp *(%eax)
</pre>
<li> Yet another fix for x86 assembly for idivl, imull, mull and friends.
<li> I've changed andl to testl in the floating point test sequence
whenever appropriate.  The Intel optimization guide states that
testl is perferable to andl.
</ol>
<p>
<li> Alpha 
<ol type="a">
<li> Some extra patterns related to loads with signed/zero extension
provided by Fermin.
<li> Added the instructions LDBU, LDWU, STB, STW as per Fermin's suggestion.
<li> Added a new mode byteWordLoadStores to the functor parameter to Alpha()
<li> Added reassociation code for address computation.
</ol>
<p>
<li> PA-RISC 
<ol type="a">
<li> B label should not be a delay slot candidate!  Why did this work?
<li> <code>ADDT(32, REG(32, r), LI n)</code> now generates one
instruction instead of two, as it should be.
<li> The assembly syntax for fstds and fstdd was wrong.
<li> Added the composite instruction <code>COMICLR/LDO</code>, which is the immediate
operand variant of <code>COMCLR/LDO</code>.
<li> Long jumps in span dependence resolution used to depend on the existence
of the base pointer in the SML/NJ runtime.  
<p>
A jump to a long label <code>L</code> was expanded into the following sequence:
<pre>     
      LDIL %hi(L-8192), %r29
      LDO  %lo(L-8192)(%r29), %r29
      ADD  %r29, baseptr, %r29
      BV,n %r0(%r29)
</pre>
I've changed it so that the following sequence of instructions 
are generated, which doesn't mention the base pointer at all:
<pre>
         BL,n  L', %r29           /* branch and link, L' + 4 -> %r29 */
    L':  ADDIL L-(L'+4), %r29     /* Compute address of L */ 
         BV,n  %r0(%r29)          /* Jump */ 
</pre>
</ol>
<p>
<li> Generic MLRISC
<ol type="a">
<li> shuffle.sml rewritten to be slightly more efficient
<li> <code>DIV</code> bug in mltree-simplify fixed (found by Fermin)
</ol>
<p>
<li> Assembly Output
<ol type="a">
<li> When generating assemby, resolve the value of client defined constants, 
instead of generating symbolic values.  This is controlled by the 
new flag "asm-resolve-constants", which is default to true.
<li> Added a new flag 
<blockquote>
<code>asm-indent-copies</code> (default to false)
</blockquote>
When this flag is on, parallel copies will be indented an extra level.
<li> Machine Descriptions/Generation
<ol type="i">
<li> The precedence parser was slightly broken when parsing infixr symbols.
<li> The type generalizing code had the bound variables reversed, resulting
in a problem during arity raising. 
<li> Various fixes in machine descriptions.
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<h3> CPS->MLRISC Code Generation </h3>
<p>
This release contains *MAJOR* changes to the way code is generated from CPS
in the module mlriscGen, and in various backend modules.
<p>
<ol>
<li> <strong>Forward propagation fix</strong>.
<p>
There was a bug in forward propagation introduced at about the same time
as the MLRISC x86 backend, which prohibits coalescing to be 
performed effectively in loops. 
<p>
Effect: speed up of loops in RISC architectures.
By itself, this actually slowed down certain benchmarks on the x86.
<p>
<li> <strong>Forward propagating addresses from consing</strong>.
<p>
I've changed the way consing code is generated.  Basically I separated 
out the initialization part:
<pre>
        store tag,   offset(allocptr)
        store elem1, offset+4(allocptr)
        store elem2, offset+8(allocptr)
        ...
        store elemn, offset+4n(allocptr)
</pre>
and the address computation part:
<pre>
        celladdr <- offset+4+alloctpr
</pre>
and move the address computation part
<p>
Effect:  register pressure is generally lower as a result.  This 
makes compilation of certain expressions much faster, such as
long lists with non-trivial elements.
<pre>
       [(0,0), (0,0), .... (0,0)]
</pre>
<p>
<li> <strong>Base pointer elimination</strong>.
<p>
As part of the linkage mechanism, we generate the sequence:
<pre>
     L:  ...  <- start of the code fragment
 
     L1:
         base pointer <- linkreg - L1 + L
</pre>
The base pointer was then used for computing relocatable addresses
in the code fragment.  Frequently (such as in lots of continuations) 
this is not needed.  We now eliminate this sequence whenever possible.
<p>
For compile time efficiency, I'm using a very stupid local heuristic.  
But in general, this should be done as a control flow analysis.
<p>
Effect:  Smaller code size.  Speed up of most programs.
<p>
<li> <strong>Frequency annotations</strong>.
<p>
I've added an annotation that states that all call gc blocks have zero
execution frequencies.  This improves register allocation on the x86.
</ol>
<p>    
<h3> Aliasing </h3>
<p>
This update contains a rewritten (and hopefully more correct) module 
for extracting aliasing information from CPS.  
<p>
To turn on this feature:  
<pre>
    Compiler.Control.CG.memDisambiguate := true
</pre>
To pretty print the region information with assembly
<pre>
    Compiler.Control.MLRISC.getFlag "asm-show-region" := true;
</pre>
To control how many levels of aliasing information are printed, use:
<pre>
    Compiler.Control.MLRISC.getInt "points-to-show-level" := n
</pre>
The default value of n is 3.

<h3> Benchmarks </h3>
<p>
I've only performed the comparison with 110.25.
<p>
   The platforms are:
<pre>  
    HPPA  A four processor HP machine (E9000) with 5G of memory.
    X86   A 300Hhz Pentium II with 128M of memory, and 
    SPARC An Ultra sparc 2 with 512M of memory.
</pre>
I used the following parameters for the SML benchmarks:
<pre>
             @SMLalloc
     HPPA    256k
     SPARC   512k
     X86     256k
</pre>
<p>
<h4> COMPILATION TIME </h4>
<p>
   Here are the numbers comparing the compilation times of the compilers.
   I've only compared 110.25 compiling the new sources versus
   a fixpoint version of the new compiler compiling the same.
<pre>
                 110.25                                  New
           Total  Time in RA  Spill+Reload   Total  Time In RA Spill+Reload
     HPPA   627s    116s        2684+3584     599s    95s       1003+1879
     SPARC  892s    173s        2891+3870     708s    116s      1004+1880
     X86    999s    315s       94006+130691   987s    296s    108877+141957

               110.25         New
            Code Size      Code Size
     HPPA   8596736         8561421
     SPARC  8974299         8785143
     X86    9029180         8716783
</pre>
   So in summary, things are at least as good as before.   Dramatic 
   reduction in compilation is obtained on the Sparc; I can't explain it, 
   but it is reproducible.  Perhaps someone should try to reproduce this 
   on their own machines.

<h4> SML BENCHMARKS </h4>
<p>
    On the average, all benchmarks perform at least as well as before.

<center><h3> Boot code and glue scripts </h3></center>

<h4> Size info in BOOTLIST </h4>
<p>
  The BOOTLIST file now has an optional first line that specifies an
  upper bound on the number of boot files and an upper bound on the
  length of each individual name.  With this, there are no longer
  hard-wired restrictions on these values in the runtime system.
  (If the specification is missing in BOOTLIST, the runtime system
  falls back to its old behavior, i.e., hard-wired defaults.)
<p>
<h4> Allocation-size heuristics in .run-sml </h4>
<p>
  The .run-sml scripts tries to read processor cache size from
  /proc/cpuinfo.  This works on Linux and is important for small-cache
  Celeron systems that suffer badly when allocation size is set too
  high.
<p>
<h4> Install script </h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Written in a more modular fashion (using shell functions).
<li> Made more robust.
<li> Automagically fetches archive files over the network if they do not
    exist locally.  Thus, you only need to fetch config.tar.gz yourself.
    Unpack it and go!
    (Requires "wget" or "lynx" to be installed on the system and a
    live connection to the internet.  Moreover, the contents of
    config/srcarchiveurl must be set properly.)
    For CVS users, this may be convenient when fetching new sets of binfiles.
<li> Handles archive files with or without version number and compressed
    with one of "gzip", "compress", or "bzip2".  Recognized suffixes are
    ".tar.gz", ".tgz", ".tar", ".tar.Z", and ".tar.bz2".
</ul>
<p>
<h4> PIDMAP file </h4>
<p>
There is a file called PIDMAP in the bootfile directory.
It is used to minimize the amount of dynamic state that needs to be
stowed away for the purpose of sharing between interactive system
and user code.
<p>
<h4> Building standalone programs </h4>
<p>
The command ml-build can be used to build standalone programs.
ml-build takes three arguments:
<ol>
<li> the name of the CM library that implements and exports the "main"
function of your program
<li> the name of the "main" function of your program as exported by 1.
(The function must have a type that makes it suitable as an argument
to SMLofNJ.exportFn.)
<li> the name of the heapfile to be generated
</ol>
<h4> Other build scripts </h4>
<p>
ml-{lex,yacc} build scripts now make use of the new mechanism for
building standalone programs.
<p>
<h4> Fixpoint script </h4>
<p>
I added a re-written version of Dave's fixpt script to src/system.
Changes relative to the original version:
<p>
<ul>
<li> sh-ified (not everybody has ksh)
<li> automatically figures out which architecture it runs on
<li> uses ./makeml a bit more cleverly
<li> never invokes ./installml (and, thus, does not clobber your
good and working installation of sml in case something goes wrong)
<li> accepts max iteration count using option "-iter <n>"
<li> accepts a "base" name using option "-base <base>"
</ul>
<p>
It does not build any extraneous heap images but directly rebuilds
bin- and boot-hierarchies using makeml's "-rebuild" switch. Finally,
it can incorporate existing bin- and boot- hierarchies.  For example,
suppose the base is set to "sml" (which is the default).  Then it
successively builds
<pre>
          sml.bin.&lt;arch&gt;-unix and sml.boot.&lt;arch&gt;-unix
  then    sml1.bin.&lt;arch&gt;-unix and sml1.boot.&lt;arch&gt;-unix
  then    sml2.bin.&lt;arch&gt;-unix and sml2.boot.&lt;arch&gt;-unix
  ...
  then    sml&lt;n&gt;.bin.&lt;arch&gt;-unix and sml&lt;n&gt;.boot.&lt;arch&gt;-unix
</pre>
and so on.  If any of these already exist, it will just use what's
there.  In particular, many people will have the initial set of bin
and boot files around, so this saves time for at least one full
rebuild.  Having sets of the form &lt;base&gt;&lt;k&gt;.{bin,boot}.&lt;arch&gt;-unix for
&lt;k&gt;=1,2,... is normally not a good idea when invoking fixpt.  However,
they might be the result of an earlier partial run of fixpt (which
perhaps got accidentially killed).  In this case, fixpt will quickly
move through what exists before continuing where it left off earlier,
and, thus, saves a lot of time.
<p>
<h4> Runtime system code </h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li> fixed several gcc -Wall warnings that were caused by missing header
files, missing initializations, etc., in runtime (not all warnings
eliminated, though)
<li> had to "un-fix" some of them later because they broke the HPPA compile
</ul>
<p>
<hr>
<center><h3> CM </h3></center>
<p>
<h4> Several manual updates </h4>
<p>
I always try to keep the manual in sync with CM's latest features.
<p>
<h4> Bootstrap compilation </h4>
<p>
No more "CMB.deliver"
<p>
<ul>
<li> All work is done by CMB.make (as it used to be in the old CM).
<li> CMB.make can be used even with existing bootfiles, i.e., bootfiles do
not have to be removed beforehand.
<li> In "paranoid mode" CM checks a stable libraries CRC checksum to
verify that it is "valid".  (In "normal mode", such checks do not
occur.)  Paranoid mode is used for bootstrap compilation.  This is
what makes it possible to re-use existing bootfiles.
</ul>
<p>
<h4> Initial glue code (init.cmi) </h4>
<ul>
<li> treated as a genuine library now
<li> there are no more "built-in" modules
</ul>
<p>
<h4> CM API </h4>
<p>
<ol>
<li> CM.Anchor.anchor instead of CM.Anchor.{set,cancel}
<ul>
<li>Upon request by Elsa.  Anchors now controlled by get-set-pair
like most other CM state variables.
</ul>
<p>
<li> CM tools:
<ul>
<li> It is now possible to have tools that accept additional
"command line" parameters (specified in the .cm file at each
instance where the tool's class is used).
<li> The parser understands named parameters and recursive options.
<li> new "make" and "shell" tools added to facilitate fairly seemless
hookup to portions of code managed using Makefiles or Shell scripts.
<li> There are no classes "shared" or "private" anymore.  Instead,
the sharing annotation is now a parameter to the "sml" class.
<li> Tools.registerStdShellCmdTool (from smlnj/cm/tool.cm) takes an
additional argument called "template" which is an optional
string that specifiel the layout of the tool command line.  See
the CM manual for explanation.
<li> A special-purpose tool can be "registered" by simply dropping
the corresponding &lt;...&gt;-tool.cm (and/or &lt;...&gt;-ext.cm) into the
same directory where the .cm file lives that uses this tool.
(The behavior/misfeature until now was to look for the tool
description files in the current working directory.)  As
before, tool description files could also be anchored -- in
which case they can live anywhere they like.  Following the
recent e-mail discussion, this change should make it easier to
have special-purpose tools that are shipped together with the
sources of the program that uses them.
<strong>Bug</strong>: such a tool does not get un-registered after being done.
</ul>
</ol>
<p>
<h4> Library names </h4>
<p>
Library names have been completely re-organized.
Many libraries have been consolidated so that they share the same
path anchor.  For example, all MLRISC-related libraries are
anchored at MLRISC, most libraries that are SML/NJ-specific are
under "smlnj".  Notice that names like host-cmb.cm or
host-compiler.cm no longer exist.  See system/README for a
complete description of the new naming scheme.  Quick reference:
<pre>
    host-cmb.cm        -&gt; smlnj/cmb.cm
    host-compiler.cm   -&gt; smlnj/compiler.cm
    full-cm.cm         -&gt; smlnj/cm.cm
    &lt;arch&gt;-&lt;os&gt;.cm     -&gt; smlnj/cmb/&lt;arch&gt;-&lt;os&gt;.cm
    &lt;arch&gt;-compiler.cm -&gt; smlnj/compiler/&lt;arch&gt;.cm
</pre>
<p>
<h4> CM bug fixes </h4>
<ul>
<li> exceptions in user code are being passed through (i.e., reach top level)
<li> more bugs in paranoia mode fixed
<li> bug related to checking group owners fixed
<li> better error handling (suppresses many followup-messages)
</ul>
<p>
<h4> Internals </h4>
<p>
<dl>
<dt>"Global" modmap:
<dd>CM now maintains one "global" modmap that is used for all stable
libraries.  The use of such a global modmap maximizes sharing and
minimizes the need for re-traversing parts of environments during
modmap construction.  (However, this has minor impact since modmap
construction seems to account for just one percent or less of total
compile time.)
</dl>
<p>

<hr>
<center><h3> Compiler Internals </h3></center>
<h4> Environment data structures: No more <code>CMStaticEnv</code> </h4>
<ul>
<li> no <code>CMEnv</code>, no <code>BareEnvironment</code> (actually,
<em>only</em> <code>BareEnvironment</code>,
but it is called <code>Environment</code>), no conversions between different
kinds of static environments.
<p>
<li> There is still a notion of a "modmap", but such modmaps are generated
on demand at the time when they are needed.  This sounds slow, but I
sped up the code that generates modmaps enough for this not to lead to
a slowdown of the compiler (at least I didn't detect any).
<p>
<li> To facilitate rapid modmap generation, static environments now
contain an (optional) "modtree" structure.  Modtree annotations are
constructed by the unpickler during unpickling.  (This means that
the elaborator does not have to worry about modtrees at all.)
Modtrees have the advantage that they are compositional in the same
way as the environment data structure itself is compositional.
As a result, modtrees never hang on to parts of an environment that
has already been rendered "stale" by filtering or rebinding.
<p>
<li> all files that I touched now compile without warnings (other than
"polyEqual" warnings).
<p>
<li> compiler now tends to run "leaner" (i.e., ties up less memory in
redundant modmaps)
</ul>
<p>
<h4> Stats phase "genmap" added </h4>
<ul>
<li>It measures time spent during on-the-fly modmap generation.
</ul>
<p>
<h4> Changes on behalf of CM </h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li><code>Compiler.CMSA</code> eliminated
<p>
No longer supported by CM anyway.
<p>
<li> Fixed bugs in pickler that kept biting Stefan
<ul>
<li> past refs to past refs (was caused by the possibility that
ad-hoc sharing is more discriminating than hash-cons sharing)
<li> integer overflow on LargeInt.minInt
</ul>
<p>
<li> Handling of "core" environment
<p>
I eliminated coreEnv from compInfo.  Access to the <code>Core</code>
structure is now done via the ordinary static environment that is
context to each compilation unit.
<p>
To this end, I arranged that instead of "structure Core" a
"structure _Core" is bound in the pervasive environment.  Core
access is done via _Core (which can never be accidentially rebound
because _Core is not a legal surface-syntax symbol).
<p>
The current solution is much cleaner because the core environment
is now simply part of the pervasive environment which is part of
every compilation unit's context anyway.  In particular, this
eliminates all special-case handling that was necessary until now
in order to deal with dynamic and symbolic parts of the core
environment.
<p>
Remaining hackery (to bind the "magic" symbol <code>_Core</code>) is localized
in the compilation mananger's bootstrap compiler (actually: in the
"init group" handling).  See the comments in
src/system/smlnj/init/init.cmi for more details.
<p>
I also tried to track down all mentions of <code>"Core"</code> (as string
argument to Symbol.strSymbol) in the compiler and replaced them
with a reference to the new <code>CoreSym.coreSym</code>.  Seems cleaner since
the actual name appears in one place only.
</ul>
