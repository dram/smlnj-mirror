  <h2><A HREF="gc-api.ps"> GC API</A></h2>
    <blockquote>
    This note describes the garbage collection interface to the
    runtime system implemented in version 110.15. All communication to
    the runtime system is through a fixed set of registers. Anything
    extra must be bundled up and saved in one of these fixed
    registers. This simplifies the runtime system significantly, 
    reduces the ML to C context switch overhead,
    and barely increases the size of code generated to invoke 
    garbage collection. 
    The net result is a
    4% improvement in compiling the compiler on the DEC Alpha.

  <h2><A HREF="k32.ps"> X86-k32</A></h2>
    <blockquote>

    This note describes the code generation algorithm used for the
    Intel x86, in version 110.16. The standard Chaitan graph coloring
    register allocation cannot be used directly for machines with few
    registers, as all temporaries wind up being spilled, making for a
    poor allocation. Thus, for the x86, the conceptual model of the
    architecture has been extended with a set of memory locations that
    are treated as registers.  The net effect is one where temporaries
    are computed into memory locations and passed as arguments to
    functions.  The use of these memory locations managed in this way
    can be as fast as using registers, where indirectly, the register
    allocation is taking into account the hardware register renaming
    mechanism.

    <h4> Performance Monitors </h4> The values of all the performance
    counters on the Pentium II were measured using version 110.17, and
    the results are shown in the table below. Each entry is in units
    of 1K counts. The meaning of each counter is explained in
    Appendix A of the <em>Intel Architecture Software Developers
    Manual; Volume 3: System Programming Guide</em> Order
    No. 243192. Each entry is the average of three runs, where one of
    the counters measured something whose value was usually close to
    zero.  I used <a
    href="http://qso.lanl.gov/~mpg/perfmon.html">pperf</a> for these
    measurements.

    <h2><A HREF="new-ra.ps" NAME="NEW-RA"> 
		A New MLRISC Register Allocator</A></h2>
      <blockquote>
	This report describes the design 
	and implementation of the new register allocator for the MLRISC
	customizable code generator.
	This new allocator, like the original allocator distributed with MLRISC,
	is a Chaitin-style graph coloring allocator that 
	uses the iterated coalescing algorithm.
	The new allocator, however, has a different client interface, uses
	different data structures, and has incorporated the following new features
	and improvements:
	<ul>
	  <p><li> Propagates and makes use of frequency information to prioritize
	    coalescing and spilling.

	  <p><li> Uses a sparse method for constructing the interference graph.
	  
	  <p><li> Has a smarter spill insertion strategy.
	  <p><li> Has a more modular design.
	</ul>

    <h2><A HREF="annotations.ps" NAME="ANNOTATIONS"> 
	      MLRISC Annotations</A></h2>
      <blockquote>
	The <tt> Annotations</tt> module written
	in Standard ML  is used extensively 
	for exchanging information between different phases in
	the MLRISC customizable code generator.   Different optimization
	phases may attach annotations to individual instructions,
	basic blocks, hyperblocks, or compilation units. These annotations
	may then be read and updated in subsequent phases.
	For instance, annotations can be used to propagate
	comments from the program text to the assembly output.
	<p>
	This document describes the interface to the annotation mechanism and
	its use within the MLRISC system.

     <h2><A HREF="matchcomp.ps" NAME="MATCHCOMP">Match Compiler
	  Notes</A></h2>
      <blockquote>
	These notes describe the SML/NJ pattern match compiler, last
	rewritten by Bill Aitken in the summer of 1992.  An 
	<A HREF="85-note-baudinet.ps">earlier paper</A> by M. Baudinet
	and D. MacQueen describs the general approach to pattern match
        compilation, but the heuristics described in that paper are
	out of date.

     <h2><A HREF="x86-fp.ps" NAME="X86 FLOATING POINT">X86 Floating Point</A></h2> 
      <blockquote>
	The floating point registers are no longer maintained as a
	stack of floating  point registers managed via the
	Sethi-Ullman numbering scheme, but as a set of registers.

     <h2><A HREF="omit-vfp.ps" NAME="OMIT VIRTUAL FRAME POINTER">
	   `Omit Virtual Frame Pointer' Optimization </A></h2> 
      <blockquote>
        In many languages, it is convenient to access local variables
        and spill locations via the use of a frame pointer. The frame
        pointer may be a physical register, or a virtual register that
        is later mapped to the stack pointer. This note describes the
        MLRISC support and requirements to rewrite uses of a virtual
        frame pointer to uses of the stack pointer -- the omit frame
        pointer optimization.

     <h2><A HREF="93-tr-reppy.ps" NAME="HIGH-PERFORMANCE GC">
	   A High-performance Garbage Collector for Standard ML </A></h2> 
      <blockquote>
      We have designed and implemented a new garbage collector for the
      Standard ML of  New Jersey System (SML/NJ). This collector has
	higher performance, lower latency, and generally requires less
	physical memory than the existing SML/NJ collector. In
	addition, it is able to exploit the large secondary caches
	found on modern workstations. This paper describes the design
	of the collector, and presents comparative performance data
	that demonstrates the above performance claims.

     <h2><A HREF="90-tr-reppy.ps" NAME="ASYNCHRONOUS SIGNALS">
	   Asynchronous Signals in Standard ML </A></h2> 
      <blockquote>
        We describe the design, implementation and use of a mechanism
	for handling asynchronous signals, such as user interrupts, in
	the New Jersey implementation of Standard ML. Providing this
	kind of mechanism is a necessary requirement for the
	development of real-world application programs. Our mechanism
	uses first-class continuations to represent the execution
	state at the time at which a signal occurs. It has been used
	to support pre-emptive scheduling in concurrency packages and
	for forcing break-points in debuggers, as well as for handling
	user interrrupts in the SML/NJ interactive environment.
