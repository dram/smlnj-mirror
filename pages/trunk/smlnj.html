<H1>What is Standard ML of New Jersey?</H1>
<HR>

<blockquote>
<STRONG>Standard ML of New Jersey</STRONG> (SML/NJ) is a compiler and
programming environment for the <A HREF="sml.html"><I>Standard
ML</I></A> programming language.  It was originally developed jointly
at Bell Laboratories and <A
HREF="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</A>, and is
now a joint project between researchers at
<A HREF="http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/wps/portal/BellLabs">
Bell Laboratories</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.lucent.com/">Lucent Technologies</A>),
<A HREF="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.cs.yale.edu/">Yale University</A> 
(<A HREF="http://flint.cs.yale.edu/">The FLINT Project</A>), and
<A HREF="http://www.research.att.com/">AT&amp;T Research</A>.
<p>
The current release of SML/NJ is
<a href="NEWS/110-README.html">Version 110</a>,
which implements the
<a href="sml97.html">SML '97</a>
revision of the Standard ML language, including the new

<a href="http://www.standardml.org/Basis/">Standard Basis</a>
-->
<a href="http://www.sml-family.org/Basis/">Standard Basis</a>
library.

<p>
Standard ML of New Jersey is written in Standard ML (except for the
runtime system, which is written in C).  SML/NJ has been used to
implement a significant number of large systems, mainly in the
fields of applied logic and verification (HOL 90, Isabelle, Step),
and program analysis and advanced compilers.  See Andrew Appel's
<A HREF="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/smlnj/projects.html">
projects page</A>.
<p>
Here is a summary of some of the major features of the SML/NJ system.
<UL>
<LI>The core of the SML/NJ system is an agressively optimizing compiler
that produces native machine code for most commonly used
architectures: x86 (IA32), Sparc, MIPS, IBM Power 1 (PowerPC), HPPA, and Alpha.
<p>
<LI>SML/NJ runs under Windows 95 and NT as well as many flavors of
Unix.  Renewed support for MacOS is planned for the next release.
<p>
<LI>SML/NJ provides an interactive top level based on incremental compilation,
but it can produce stand-alone executables using the exportFn function.
<p>
<LI>SML/NJ uses Matthias Blume's <em>Compilation Manager</em>,
<A HREF="doc/CM/index.html">CM</A>,
to greatly simplify the development of large software projects.
<p>
<LI>A variety of general-purpose data structures, algorithms
and utilities (such as finite sets and maps, regular expressions,
pretty-printing) are provided by the
<A HREF="doc/smlnj-lib/index.html">
SML/NJ library</A>.
<p>
<LI>Concurrent programming in SML is supported by the
<a href="http://cml.cs.uchicago.edu/"><em>Concurrent ML</em></a>
library.
<p>
<LI>
<a href="http://www.cis.ksu.edu/~stough/eXene/index.html"><em>eXene</em></a>
is a graphical interface toolkit for X-windows based on Concurrent ML.
<p>
<LI>SML/NJ extends the SML '97 language with
higher-order functors, OR-patterns, first-class continuations, 
and a number of other useful <a href="doc/features.html">features</a>.
<p>
<LI>Support for manipulating "object languages" (e.g. logics, calculi,
simple programming languages, specification languages) is provided by
a simple <a href="doc/quote.html">quote/anitquote</a> mechanism.
