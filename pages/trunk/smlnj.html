<H1>What is Standard ML of New Jersey?</H1>
<HR>

<blockquote>
<STRONG>Standard ML of New Jersey</STRONG> (SML/NJ) is a compiler and
programming environment for the <A HREF="sml.html"><I>Standard
ML</I></A> programming language.  It was originally developed jointly
at Bell Laboratories and <A
HREF="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</A>, and is
now a joint project between researchers at
<A HREF="http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/wps/portal/BellLabs">
Bell Laboratories</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.lucent.com/">Lucent Technologies</A>),
<A HREF="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.cs.yale.edu/">Yale University</A> 
(<A HREF="http://flint.cs.yale.edu/">The FLINT Project</A>), and
<A HREF="http://www.research.att.com/">AT&amp;T Research</A>.
<p>
The current release of SML/NJ is
<a href="NEWS/110-README.html">Version 110</a>,
which implements the
<a href="sml97.html">SML '97</a>
revision of the Standard ML language, including the new
<a href="http://www.standardml.org/Basis/">Standard Basis</a>
library.
<p>
<STRONG>SML/NJ</STRONG> is distributed free of charge with source
code, but with no warranty.  You may use, copy, modify, and distribute
the software provided that you preserve the copyright notice and don't
mention Bell Labs or Lucent Technologies in your advertising without
prior written agreement; see the <A HREF="license.html">license and

<p>
Standard ML of New Jersey is written in Standard ML (except for the
runtime system, which is written in C).  SML/NJ has been used to
implement a significant number of large systems, mainly in the
fields of applied logic and verification (HOL 90, Isabelle, Step),
and program analysis and advanced compilers.  See Andrew Appel's
<A HREF="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/smlnj/projects.html">
projects page</A>.
<p>
Here is a summary of some of the major features of the SML/NJ system.
<UL>
<LI>The core of the SML/NJ system is an agressively optimizing compiler
that produces native machine code for most commonly used
architectures: x86 (IA32), Sparc, MIPS, IBM Power 1 (PowerPC), HPPA, and Alpha.
<p>
<LI>SML/NJ runs under Windows 95 and NT as well as many flavors of
Unix.  Renewed support for MacOS is planned for the next release.
<p>
<LI>SML/NJ provides an interactive top level based on incremental compilation,
but it can produce stand-alone executables using the exportFn function.
<p>
<LI>SML/NJ uses Matthias Blume's <em>Compilation Manager</em>,
<A HREF="doc/CM/index.html">CM</A>,
to greatly simplify the development of large software projects.
<p>
<LI>A variety of general-purpose data structures, algorithms
and utilities (such as finite sets and maps, regular expressions,
pretty-printing) are provided by the
<A HREF="doc/smlnj-lib/index.html">
SML/NJ library</A>.
<p>
<LI>Concurrent programming in SML is supported by the
<a href="http://cml.cs.uchicago.edu/"><em>Concurrent ML</em></a>
library.
<p>
<LI>
<a href="http://www.cis.ksu.edu/~stough/eXene/index.html"><em>eXene</em></a>
is a graphical interface toolkit for X-windows based on Concurrent ML.
<p>
<LI>SML/NJ extends the SML '97 language with
higher-order functors, OR-patterns, first-class continuations, 
and a number of other useful <a href="doc/features.html">features</a>.
<p>
<LI>Support for manipulating "object languages" (e.g. logics, calculi,
simple programming languages, specification languages) is provided by
a simple <a href="doc/quote.html">quote/anitquote</a> mechanism.
