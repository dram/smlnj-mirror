    <h1>More Advice on CVS Branches</h1>

<h3>Addendum to Branch Management Advice</h3>
<p>
Stefan Monnier, 04/21/2000
<p>
It is pretty common to use
<pre>
        foobar-branch-tag and foobar-banch-tag-root
</pre>
instead of
<pre>
        foobar-devel-tag and foobar-main-tag
</pre>
there have been proposals on the CVS list to provide an automatic way
to get the "root" with something like foobar-branch-tag.0 or
foobar-branch-tag.ROOT or somesuch. Of course, nothing came of
these, since CVS development is close enough to moribund.
<p>
The problem Matthias mentions when merging changes from the trunk to the
branch can be solved in the following way
[Note: I assume that the user has put `update -dP' in his ~/.cvsrc file.]:
<ol>
<li> Update the trunk and tag the "new root":
<pre>
        cd ~/ML/MainTrunk/smlnj
        cvs update
        cvs tag joe-tmp
</pre>
<li> Merge changes between old root and new root:
<pre>
        cd ~/ML/smlnj
        cvs update -j joe_main_v110p27p4_2 -j joe-tmp
</pre>
<li> Move the root:
<pre>
        cvs rtag -d joe_main_v110p27p4_2
        cvs tag -r joe-tmp joe_main_v110p27p4_2
        cvs tag -d joe-tmp
</pre>
</ol>
Note that instead of using `<code>cvs rtag -d</code>' and 
`<code>cvs tag</code>' I could just use
`<code>cvs tag -F</code>', except that it would not remove the
tag on files that were removed between the two points.
<p>
The advantage of moving the root tag like this instead of creating
a new branch is that it requires fewer steps and that it doesn't pollute
RCS files nearly as much (do a `<code>cvs log</code>' on a few files
in the current directory and you'll see the impressive number of tags
compared to the fairly short age of the repository).
Also it saves you from coming up with yet-another-name.
<p>
Funnily enough, this technique relies on an explicit "root tag":
an automatic foobar-branch-tag.ROOT would not cut the mustard.

<h3>Earlier Advice on Branches</h3>
<p>
CVS has many quirks which lead to several "Commandments" to help you
avoid them.  Among those are the following two:
<ul>
<li><em>When branching, always start by tagging the current code and then
branch off of that tag</em>.
It's very often needed/convenient to find the `root' of a branch, but CVS
offers no way to do that automatically. This shouldn't be difficult to fix in
CVS, but noone has done it yet. In the mean time, you need to create a tag
manually:
<pre>
        cvs tag &lt;branch&gt;-ROOT
        cvs tag -b &lt;branch&gt;
</pre>
<p>
<li> <em>When merging, always provide both `-j' arguments</em>.
CVS can automatically infer the ancestor between the two merge points,
and hence only requires one `-j' argument.  But this automatic
inference is rather crude and often does not do what you want, leading
to spurious conflicts.
I.e. don't do
<pre>
        cvs update -j &lt;branch&gt;
</pre>
but
<pre>
        cvs update -j &lt;branch&gt;-ROOT -j &lt;branch&gt;
</pre>
or
<pre>
        cvs update -j last-merge-on-&lt;branch&gt; -j &lt;branch&gt;
</pre>
To figure out what is `last-merge-on-&lt;branch&gt;', there are two techniques:
<ol>
<li> each time you merge, stop using the branch (and create a new one
off of the newer version if you want to keep hacking on a branch).
<li> move the &lt;branch&gt;-ROOT tag to the "new root" (on the branch).
<pre>
        cvs update -j &lt;branch&gt;-ROOT -j &lt;branch&gt;
        &lt;...resolve conflicts and commit...>
        &lt;..there's a race condition here..>
        cvs tag -F -r &lt;branch&gt; &lt;branch&gt;-ROOT
</pre>
This way, &lt;branch&gt;-ROOT always contains the last-merged revision.
</ol>
<p>
Matthias was caught by the `cvs update -j &lt;branch&gt;' problem where he
thought that CVS would automatically find the right common ancestor
to do the merge.  This seemed reasonable since he only had a branch
off of the main trunk and hadn't merged anything back yet, so finding
the ancestor should have been trivial.  It turned out that his branch
was made off of the magic-vendor-branch (used when importing files),
so he ended up merging 1.1.1.19 (for example) and 1.3 where 1.3 is
a direct descendent of 1.1.1.19, but this is muddied up by the magic-branch.
The common ancestor ended up being 1.1 which happens to be the very
first version I entered in the repository (i.e. 110.5 of there about).
<p>
His specific problem could have been avoided had I not used `cvs import'
to create the repository, but the above two rules will save you in
several other cases as well.
