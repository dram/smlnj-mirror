    <h1>SML/NJ Development Info</h1>
<p>
<p>
These pages contain planning and other information related to the
development of SML/NJ.  The purpose is to coordinate between the
geographically dispersed subgroups of the sml-nj community.  These
pages are currently not being publicized beyond the sml-nj mailing
list.
<p>
We want these pages to keep track of who is doing what, when, and why,
and to map dependencies between efforts.  We also maintain documentation
on how to use the CVS repositories at Yale and SourceForge to maintain
the SML/NJ source code and web pages.
<p>
These pages are maintained by Lal and Dave, so please send them
updates and corrections and relevant links.  Also suggestions are
welcome as to what additional information should be maintained here.

<p>

<h3>SML/NJ SourceForge project</h3>
The <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/smlnj/">
SML/NJ SourceForge project</a> is now in use and under active development.
See the SourceForge <a href="sf-howto.html">HOWTO</a> page for instructions
on using the smlnj project.
<p>
Currently the CVS repository contains the bugs directory (module bugs) and the
SML/NJ web pages (module htdocs, which is an alias for module pages).  The
htdocs module is checkout out into the main project directory (/home/groups/s/sm/smlnj)
to provide a mirror of the web pages at www.smlnj.org, which is served by
SourceForge.
<p>
The copy of the web pages at Bell Labs is now also a working copy
checked out from the SourceForge repository.  For the time being, both
the Bell Labs URL (<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/what/smlnj">
http://cm.bell-labs.com/what/smlnj</a>) and the
SourceForge URL (<a href="http://www.smlnj.org">http://www.smlnj.org</a>)
will be maintained from this repository, so they should remain in sync.
<p>
The plan is to move the source repository from Yale to SourceForge in
the future.  This relocation will increase the number of people who
can help to maintain the repository.
<p>
<p>
<h3>Yale CVS Repository</h3>
We are using the Yale CVS Repository to hold the master code for
the compiler, libraries and tools, and for private development
branches.  The initial state of the repository is based on 
working version 110.26 (even though this was never released as
a normal working version).
<p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Policy</strong>.  This <A HREF="policy.html">policy
statement</A> lays out the rules and procedures for administering
the CVS repository [last revised 3/8/00].
<p><li><strong>Repository README</strong>. The
<a href="cvs-readme.html"><strong>cvs-readme</strong></a>
page contains instructions on accessing the Yale repository
and instructions and advice on using CVS.
<p><li><strong>Location</strong>.  The repository's CVS root is
<pre>
  flint.cs.yale.edu:/home/cvs
</pre>
<p><li><strong>Repository Map</strong>.  The structure of the repository is described by this
<a href="cvs-map.html"><strong>map</strong></a>.
<p><li><strong>Boot files</strong>. The location of the current boot files for building the
compiler corresponding to the current state of the repository is
given in the file <code>smlnj/BOOT</code> in the repository.  The file
<code>smlnj/HISTORY</code> tracks all changes that have been committed.
<p><li><strong>Mailing List</strong>. To get email reports on all commits to the repository,
subscribe to the <a href="mailto:smlnj-cvs@rum.cs.yale.edu">smlnj-cvs</a> 
mailing list by sending a message to
<a href="mailto:smlnj-cvs-request@rum.cs.yale.edu">
smlnj-cvs-request@rum.cs.yale.edu</a> with subject:
<pre>
  subscribe &lt;your@email.address&gt;
</pre>
<p>
<li> <strong>Managing Branches</strong>.  CVS branches are useful but also tricky. 
<a href="http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~blume/SMLNJ-DEV/cvs.html">
<strong>These notes</strong></a> by Matthias Blume
provide a summary of useful commands and procedures to follow when
using branches.  Additional advice on branches can be found in
<a href="cvs-branch2.html">Stefan Monnier's follow-up notes</a>.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Benchmarks</h3>
<p>
All the benchmark compile times and run times have been graphed going
back to 110.0.3. All measurements were done on a DEC alpha at the
Labs. The following conclusions appear to be supported by the graphs:
<ul>
 <p><li> Version 110.12, which is the new array representation alone, 
      did not have a significant impact on both compile and execution
      time. 

  <p><li> Version 110.11 (the combination of NEW FLINT and array
	  representation) did have a significant overall impact.
	  Note that the NEW FLINT was subsequently retracted. 

  <p><li> In general execution time has remained the same or has
	  steadily improved over the working versions. 

  <p><li> Compile time has steadily increased but not by anything
	  significant. 
</ul>

<h3>SML/NJ Developers mailing lists</h3>
There are two mailing lists for communication to and among the SML/NJ
developers.  The addresses are:
<pre>
  <a href="mailto:sml-nj@research.bell-labs.com">sml-nj@research.bell-labs.com</a>
  <a href="mailto:sml-bugs@research.bell-labs.com">sml-bugs@research.bell-labs.com</a>
</pre>
Currently, both mailing lists go to the same group of people, and the
members are listed below.
