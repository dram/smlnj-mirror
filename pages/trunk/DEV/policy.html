<h1> Policy for Managing Unified SML/NJ CVS Repository </h1>

In order to improve coordination of the various people contributing to
the development and maintenance of SML/NJ, we have established a
single master CVS repository accessible to all.  In order for this
plan to work well, we need to agree on a policy or set of guidelines
for how the repository should be managed.
<p>
This policy document is still evolving; comments, corrections,
and suggestions are encouraged.
<p>
See the <a href="cvs-readme.html">cvs-readme</a> file for additional
advice about accessing and using the repository.
<p>
<h3>1. Location</h3>

The master repository from with Release and Working versions have been
created in the past has been at Bell Labs.  The obvious problem with
this arrangement is that people not at Bell Labs do not have access
through the firewall.  CVS supports remote operations on a repository
(with selective password authorization) as long as the repository is
accessible, so the repository should reside on a system that everyone
has access to.  The new common repository is be hosted by Yale.  The
address of the repository is:
<pre>
  flint.cs.yale.edu:/home/cvs
</pre>

<p>
<h3>2. Administration</h3>
<h4>2.1. Repository Administrator</h4>
There is a repository administrator (currently 
<a href="mailto:monnier@cs.yale.edu">Stefan Monnier</a>) whose
responsibilities include creating and organizing the repository,
ensuring that the repository is backed up, setting up access for
developers and the user community, and generally solving problems
that require full access to the repository host machine.  A deputy
or backup administrator should be designated.
<p>
<h4>2.2. Access</h4>
There are two levels of access privileges: developer and user.
<p>
<strong>Developers.</strong>
The privilege to commit changes is restricted to "active" developers
(effectively those on the sml-nj mailing list).  Each developer can
checkout, commit, tag the repository, create branches, and import new
directories.  There is a strong obligation on developers to
communicate the nature and extent of changes they are making to
the group via the sml-nj mailing list.
<p>
Developers outside Yale will use ssh to access the repository
remotely.  Procedures for using ssh are documented in the
<a href="cvs-readme.html">cvs-readme</a> file.
<p>
<strong>Users.</strong>
It has become common practice in the "open source" movement to have an
open CVS repository that _anyone_ can checkout from.  This seems to be
a reasonable policy for the SML/NJ repository.  As a consequence,
adventurous users can try out a snapshot of the code under
development, and as with our current "working versions", they do so at
the risc of encountering bugs and instabilities.
<p>
<h4>2.3. Backup</h4>
The repository should be backed up on a daily basis (probably by
normal file system backups of the server hosting the repository).
<p>

<h3>3. Maintaining stability: Prerequisites for commits</h3>

We want to have developers commit their changes frequently enough so
that the community remains synchronized, but we don't want partial or
half-baked changes committed.  Most importantly, we don't want changes
committed that break the system (recognizing of course that some
changes may introduce bugs no matter how careful we try to be).  So
here are some guidelines on the procedure for checking in changes.
<ol>
<li> Do an update from the repository to incorporate any new changes
     that have been checked in since your working copy was checked out
     or updated (frequent updates are a good policy in general).
<p>
<li> Make sure your version compiles to a fixed point.  If you are
     making changes that are clearly platform independent (e.g. to
     the type checker), it may be sufficient to do this on one
     architecture.  If your changes are specific to one architecture
     (e.g. changes to x86 specific code generator files), then
     compiling to a fixed point on that architecture should suffice.
     If your changes affect non-architecture-specific code generation,
     you should check all architectures (this may require help from
     someone who has access to architectures that you don't have).
<p>
<li> Do further testing as appropriate.  How much testing depends.
     For a minor front-end bug fix, running the regression test on
     one platform may do.  For more extensive changes that may effect
     multiple platforms, regression tests should be run on all
     platforms.  One can also build and test some large applications
     to improve confidence.
<p>
<li> Do another update to see if any changes have occurred since step
     1.  If any have, go back and repeat steps 2 and 3.
<p>
<li> rtag the repository (the core set of directories, see Section 8)
to mark the state before your changes.
<p>
<li> Do the checkin.  Checkins should include useful log comments.
<p>
<li> rtag the repository again to mark the state immediately after your
changes.
<p>
<li> Create a description of the changes checked in, including the
associated tag names, the nature and purpose of the changes, and a
list of files checked in.  Add this description to the history file
sml/HISTORY in the repository and send it vial email to the sml-nj
mailing list (or the smlnj-cvs mailing list?).
<p>
<li> If the changes checked in require a nontrivial bootstrap
proceedure (i.e. anything other than iterating recompiles to a
fixed point) a set of boot files for the standard platforms should
be provided.  The boot files should be made available for
ftp from the flint.cs.yale.edu server, but in the interim the
file sml/BOOT contains a record of the location of the latest
boot files and what tag they are associated with.  Whenever new
boot files are required, the tertiary verion number (e.g. x in
110.26.x) should be incremented along with the date in the file
<pre>
   src/compiler/TopLevel/main/version.sml
</pre>
This should be done before committing, tagging and building the
boot files.
</ol>
If you are going to make a series of commits over a period
of several hours, and the repository will be in a nonworking
(i.e. noncompilable) state between commits, please send mail to sml-nj
or smlnj-cvs to warn people not to do updates until you are finished
with your commits, and send followup mail indicating that you have
finished and it is safe to commit.
<p>
Another suggestion is that after finishing your commits, you do an
update on smlnj to verify that all your locally modified files have
been committed.
<p>
In order to avoid "performance bugs", where a change significantly
slows down the compiler or the generated code, it would be a good idea
to also run benchmarks before checking in.
<p>
If you are starting on an extensive set of changes, it would be a good
idea to warn the sml-nj list about what you are planning to do, indicating
what parts of the system will be affected.  Coordinate with other
developers in detail as appropriate, and get their cooperation and
agreement when necessary.
<p>
If your changes have a negative effect, like (temporarily) removing
support for a particular architecture or (temporarily) turning off
some important function, or (temporarily) reducing performance, it
is particularly important to warn the developer community and explain
how <em>and when</em> the temporary problem will be corrected.
<p>

<h3>5. History, tagging, building boot files, building distributions</h3>

We tag the repository to mark milestones and to create reference
points in the development that can be documented, and that we can back
out to if necessary.  With a common CVS repository, we will be
updating and taging the code on a much more frequent basis.  
<p>
<strong>HISTORY and BOOT files.</strong>There are two special files in the
repository for recording information about changes and new boot file
sets.
<dl>
<dt>sml/HISTORY
<dd>The change history for the repository.  Must be updated for each
commit.  Will be used to prepare version README files.
<p>
<dt>sml/BOOT
<dd>Records the location of the current (and past) sets of boot files.
Should be associated with a CVS tag.
</dl>
<p>
<strong>Documenting tags.</strong> Tags will be documented in the
sml/HISTORY file, and a record of the tags will be available using the
cvs history command:
<pre>
  cvs history -a -T
</pre>
<blockquote>
NOTE: for tags to be recorded in the cvs history file, they
must be created using the "rtag" command rather than the "tag"
command.  If you use "tag" instead of "rtag", the only effective
way to tell the community about the tag is to record it in the
sml/HISTORY file.
<p>
There is a slight chance of a race condition when using rtag: someone
may do a commit while you are in the process of performing the
rtag command, in which case the tagged revisions might not correspond
with the revisions in your working directory.  The tag command does
not have this problem; it always tags the revisions corresponding to
the ones in your working directory.
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>When to tag.</strong> Here are some guidelines on when to tag.
<ol>
<li> Tag (before and) after any significant set of changes has been
committed. What constitutes significant is a judgement call -- error
on the side of tagging when in doubt.
<p>
<li> Tag after a sufficient accumulation of small changes.  This might
be covered by tagging at least once every month or two months, even in
the absence of major changes.  Of course, it's not necessary to tag if
_no_ changes have occurred since the last tag.
<p>
<li> Tag when creating a new version (i.e. when incrementing the compiler
version number and date in src/compiler/TopLevel/main/version.sml).
</ol>
<p>
<strong>What to tag.</strong> The tag should be applied to the set of
core compiler "working set" of directories, including at least the
following:
<pre>
  sml/config
  sml/src/MLRISC
  sml/src/cm
  sml/src/compiler
  sml/src/runtime
  sml/src/system
</pre>
Note that this is a subset of smlnj (see Section 8 below), the minimal
set of directories that must be checked out to build the compiler from
sources, since it does not include sml/src/ml-yacc and
sml/src/smlnj-lib.  There could be an module corresponding to this
core working set, namely the compiler-set suggested in Section 8.
Ideally the modules smlnj-lib and ml-yacc that are relatively stable
compared with the compiler and are maintained independently of the
compiler should have their own separate tags and version history.
<p>
<strong>Tag name format.</strong> The suggested format for tag names is:
<blockquote>
  &lt;name&gt;-&lt;date:yyyymmdd&gt;-&lt;comment phrase&gt;
</blockquote>
for instance:
<pre>
  dbm-20000224-fix_bug_1544
</pre>
<p>
Note that one can check whether any changes have been committed since
the last tag by usiing the cvs diff command:
<pre>
  cvs diff -r &lt;tag-name&gt; -r HEAD
</pre>
<p>
<strong>Boot files.</strong> A new set of boot files should be
provided whenever changes require a nontrivial bootstrap procedure.
The boot files will be placed in an ftp directory on [a designated ftp
server - tbd].
<p>
<strong>Version increments.</strong> When accumulated changes warrant
it, we will increment the minor version number and build a
distribution.  A distribution consists of a version README
(summarizing changes documented in the HISTORY file and providing
benchmark results), a set of source tarballs, and a set of boot
tarballs (i.e. sml.boot.*.tgz).

<p>
<h3>6. Branches </h3>

The normal procedure will be to check out a working copy, modify that
working copy, update, test, and commit changes.  In some cases it may be
convenient or necessary to create a branch in the repository,
particularly when two geographically distributed developers want to
collaborate on changes.  We advise great caution when using branches
in the main repository, and suggest that you read the documentation
on branches thoroughly and make sure you understand how they work.
Be particularly careful when updating a working copy of a repository
branch (e.g. never use "update -A" in such circumstances).
<p>
When working on a branch, try to keep the branch and the trunk as much
in sync as possible:
<ul>
<li> merge changes from the trunk into your branch as often as you can.
<li> merge the branch back into the trunk as soon as the branch is stable
enough.
</ul>
The only reason for not merging a branch whose code is working is that
it is uncertain whether the code will ever be merged into the trunk
(i.e. it's experimental).
<p>
The <a href="cvs-readme.html">cvs-readme</a> file contains more advice about
using branches.
<p>

<h3>8. Contents and organization of the Repository</h3>

The repository will contain
<ol>
<li> components of the compiler itself (config, runtime, compiler,
MLRISC, system, cm)
<li> libraries and tools (smlnj-lib, ml-lex, ml-yacc, ml-burg,
smlnj-c)
<li> testing and benchmarking code (tests, benchmarks)
<li> other packages (CML, eXene, ckit)
</ol>
There is a <a href="cvs-map.html">repository map</a> that documents
the current directory structure of the repository.
<p>
Some directories may have more restrictive access policies (i.e.
may limit the set of developers allowed to commit changes to the
directory).
<p>
The repository supports the following "modules" or virtual
projects:
<ol>
<li> The smlnj module consists of the set of directories needed
to build the compiler from sources (i.e. those necessary to bootstrap
the compiler). smlnj contains the following
<pre>
  smlnj/config
  smlnj/src/runtime
  smlnj/src/compiler
  smlnj/src/MLRISC
  smlnj/src/system
  smlnj/src/cm
  smlnj/src/ml-yacc
  smlnj/src/smlnj-lib
</pre>
<li> The set of core compiler components that should be tagged when
committing changes.  This will be called "compiler-set" and will
consist of the components of boot-set except for ml-yacc and smlnj-lib.
</ol>
The directory structure of the repository and of the compiler
distribution should be coordinated.

<h3>9. Keywords</h3>
CVS keywords (such as Dollar-Log-Dollar) will not be used in the sml source.
Log, version, and status information for files can be accessed using
the "cvs log" and "cvs status" commands.

<h3>10. Mailing list</h3>

There is a mailing list, <a
href="mailto:smlnj-cvs@rum.cs.yale.edu">smlnj-cvs</a>, that will
automatically receive messages announcing commits to the repository.
To join the mailing list, send mail to <a
href="mailto:smlnj-cvs-request@rum.cs.yale.edu">
smlnj-cvs-request@rum.cs.yale.edu</a> with subject:
<pre>
  subscribe &lt;your@email.address&gt;
</pre>

<!--
In either case we need to make things more transparent.

   How is the repository organized?  (We need a map.)
     * What are the top-level directories (called "projects" in the
       Fogel book)?
     * What are the modules and how are they defined?
       - Stefan has mentioned smlnj and sml.  Is smlnj a directory, or 
         an alias module (defined with module -a).
       - Can directories within a module like smlnj have different
	 access policies (note that smlnj-lib is a component of the
         smlnj module)?
     * What is the rationale for the repository organization?
       (e.g. the smlnj module gives you everything needed to build the
        compiler (except the runtime).)
     * binaries will be stored outside the repository?
     * should we reorganize the source tree to agree with the
       repository organization?

   How is it managed?
     * Access permissions? 
       - The world should be able to check anything out.
       - John (presumably with Emden?) wants exclusive checkin rights
         for smlnj-lib (and CML, and eXene).  [I don't agree with
	 this exclusivity, but I'll go along with it.]
     * Security: ssh management
     * tagging policy
       - when we tag (for routine commits, versions, whatever), what
         collections of code (e.g. modules) do we tag?  Should one tag
	 just MLRISC, or compiler, or system, or all of smlnj.  Should
	 only John and Emden tag smlnj-lib if only they have commit
	 privileges?
     * Version management
       - who is responsible, who decides when to create a new version
       - tagging a version
       - building the binaries (need for all platforms)
       - running regressions and benchmarks
       - generating version READMEs
     * What happens when there is a major code reorganization?
       - Build a new repository?
       - Introduce new versions of projects/directories like "compiler" or "MLRISC"?
     * branch policy
       - branches permitted but discouraged, extreme care should be exercised when 
	 merging, and NEVER do an "update -A" on a branch.
     * keyword policy
       - I favor removing the Log keyword from teh sources and
         relying on the cvs log command, since we will now all have
         access to this information from the repository.

   Usage guidelines, hints, suggestions?
     * managing ssh access with ssh-agent, etc.
     * update + compile to fixed point before any commit (regressions
       and benchmarks are advised - shame on he who commits buggy code
       or performance degrading code!)
     * meaningful log messages for commits
     * tagging after every commit (e.g. "dbm-2000_1_12")
     * email announcement after every commit/tag (mention tag, list
       files changed)
     * change log (maybe just a record of the email announcements)
