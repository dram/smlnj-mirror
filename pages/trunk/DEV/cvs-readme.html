<h1>Instructions for use of Yale CVS Repository</h1>
<p>
<p>
This page provides basic information, advice, and hints for using
the SML/NJ CVS repository at Yale.
<p>
<h3>Repository address</h3>
<pre>
   flint.cs.yale.edu:/home/cvs
</pre>
<p>
<h3>Mailing list</h3>
<p>
There is a mailing list, <a href="mailto:smlnj-cvs@rum.cs.yale.edu">
smlnj-cvs@rum.cs.yale.edu</a>, that will
automatically receive messages announcing commits to the repository.
To join the mailing list, send mail to
<a href="mailto:smlnj-cvs-request@rum.cs.yale.edu">smlnj-cvs-request@rum.cs.yale.edu</a>
with subject:
<pre>
  subscribe &lt;your@email.address&gt;
</pre>
<p>
<h3>Setting up and using ssh</h3>
<ol>
<li> <strong>To get access</strong>: send <a href="mailto:monnier@cs.yale.edu">
Stefan Monnier</a> your public SSH-1
key along with a set of machine names (full domain paths)
from which you'll login.  Here is how you can generate an
SSH-1 key and transmit it to Stefan:
<pre>
   % ssh-keygen
   % Mail -s "here you are" monnier@cs.yale.edu &lt;~/.ssh/identity.pub
</pre>
<code>ssh-keygen<code> will ask you to enter a passphrase, which you'll
need to remember and use whenever you use the Yale repository.
<p>
You can check whether your access is authorized by executing
<pre>
     ssh -v flint.cs.yale.edu
</pre>
<p>
<li> <strong>set CVS_RSH</strong>
<pre>
   export CVS_RSH=ssh
</pre>
<p>
<li> use <strong>ssh-agent</strong> to set up for cvs usage.
ssh-agent produces three lines of shell commands that should be evaled
<pre>
   eval `ssh-agent`
</pre>
<li> use <strong>ssh-add</strong> to authenticate for the whole session.
ssh-add adds identity from ~/.ssh.  Using this command, you won't be asked
for authentication on each cvs command.
</ol>
<p>
Here is a script that can be "sourced" to do all these steps:
<pre>
    export CVS_RSH=ssh
    export CVSROOT=flint.cs.yale.edu:/home/cvs
    eval `ssh-agent`
    ssh-add &lt;&lt;EOF
    &lt;insert your passphrase here&gt;
    EOF
</pre>
Note that if you have your DISPLAY variable set, the ssh-add ignores
its standard input and pops up a dialog box into which you must type your
passphrase.
<p>

<h3>CVS Hints</h3>
<ol>
<li> Typical command:
<pre>
     cvs -d flint.cs.yale.edu:/home/cvs co smlnj
</pre>
<p>
<li> To avoid having to specify the repository in each command, you can set
CVSROOT:
<pre>
     export CVSROOT=flint.cs.yale.edu:/home/cvs
</pre>
<p>
<li> It is recommended to have a ~/.cvsrc file containing
<pre>
	% cat ~/.cvsrc
	update -P -d
	checkout -P
	% 
</pre>
The -P tells CVS to prune empty directories.  The -d tells CVS
to add new directories that have been created in the repository
since the last update.
<p>
<li> When using `cvs import' it's useful to first try a dry run
`cvs -n import' so you can fix the -I options (i.e. what files to
ignore) or any other problems.  Note that symbolic links are
ignored by import.  The global -n option for cvs suppresses any
action and only generates reports of what the command would do.
</ol>

<h3>Reminder: Tag all of smlnj module when committing</h3>
<p>
Matthias Blume, 31 Mar 2000
<p>
This is a reminder to everybody who is checking stuff into the CVS
repository that they should tag the _entire_ repository (actually --
the entiry "smlnj" module if what you are doing is compiler-related).
Otherwise tags are much less useful.
<p>
In this case I wanted to compare my "blume_main_v110p26p2_0" with the
version _before_ that.  For this, I tried to use the previous tag --
which was created by Alan.  However, as it turns out, Alan tagged only
those files he actually changed.  As a result, CVS gave me only those
files.
<p>
In other words, if a file does not have a certain tag, then it is
considered non-existent.  There is a flag to "cvs update" that lets
one change this behavior to "use the most recent version", but this is
<em>also</em> not what I wanted.
<p>
The other "solution" would be to really always tag "before" and
"after" a commit.  My point is that "before" tags are completely
redundant if "after" tags are properly applied to the entire
repository.
<p>
My current workaround is to use dates. (This proved a bit tricky
because it wasn't obvious from the outset relative to which timezone
the date would be interpreted... :)

<h3>Anonymous CVS</h3>
<p>
Stefan Monnier, 7 Apr 2000
<p>
I have a tentative setup for anonymous CVS working on rum (aka flint).
To try it out, do the following:
<pre>
        % cvs -d :pserver:cvsguest@flint.cs.yale.edu:/guest login
        passwd: cvs
        % cvs -d :pserver:cvsguest@flint.cs.yale.edu:/guest co smlnj
<pre>
