<h1>SML/NJ Old News</h1>

<ul>
  <li>[2/2/07] Working
  version <a href="dist/working/110.62/index.html">110.62</a> available.
    <font size="-1">
      (Version
      <a href="dist/working/110.61/index.html">110.61</a> did not get
      announced.)
    </font>
  </li>
 <li>Working version
  <a href="dist/working/110.60/index.html">110.60</a> available.
  New directory layout, subversion-based source repository,
  beta-releases of new program generator tools.</li>
<li>Working version
    <a href="dist/working/110.59/index.html">110.59</a> available.
    Bugfixes and minor improvements.</li>
<li>Working version
    <a href="dist/working/110.58/index.html">110.58</a> available.
    Among other improvements, this version adds support for
    Intel-based Macs as well as x86-64-based Linux machines.  Moreover,
    it comes with <b>lexgen</b>, a brand-new drop-in replacement for
    <tt>ml-lex</tt>.</li>
<li>Working version
    <a href="dist/working/110.57/index.html">110.57</a>
    available.  Bugfixes and minor feature enhancements.</li>
<li><a href="new.html#110.51">Working version 110.51 available.</a>
  This version adds 64-bit integer and word arithmetic to the
  <i>Basis</i> library (structures <tt>Int64</tt> and
  <tt>Word64</tt>).  (At the moment, the implementation is rather
  inefficient, though.)</li>
<li><a href="new.html#110.50">Working version 110.50 available.</a>
  This version corrects a problem related to <tt>struct</tt> arguments
  and results with NLFFI on the x86 platform.  It also improves
  back-trace support and adds a simple test coverage tool.
  In addition, CM can now deal directly with "lazy sml" source code.</li>
<li><a href="new.html#110.49">Working version 110.49 available.</a>
  Version 110.49 fixes another show-stopper bug in the x86 c-calls
  implementation, fixes a bug in the signal masking code, and enables
  Cygwin support.</li>
<li><a href="new.html#110.48">Working version 110.48 available.</a>
  Version 110.48 fixes a show-stopper bug in the x86 c-calls
  implementation introduced by 110.47.  It also resolves a few other
  minor issues.</li>
<li><a href="new.html#110.47">Working version 110.47 available.</a>
  The most important change is the availability of preliminary
  implementations of the NLFFI foreign-function interface under Mac OS
  X and Win32.</li>
<li><a href="new.html#110.46">Working version 110.46 available.</a>
   We are moving closer to compliance with the Basis Library specification.
   There are also bugfixes and other minor enhancements to the installer,
   the Windows port, the <tt>ml-build</tt> command-line tool, and
   the Compilation Manager.
   </li>
<li><a href="new.html#110.45">Working version 110.45 available.</a>
   This is a maintenance release which mostly fixes problems compiling
   the runtime system code using GCC 3.3.
   </li>
<li><a href="new.html#110.44">Working version 110.44 available.</a>
   This update fixes several important bugs, improves the new
   installer, provides support for Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther), and
   continues to bring the Basis implementation closer to the
   specification.</li>
<li><a href="new.html#110.43">Working version 110.43 available.</a>
   This is a fairly major update which brings back an operational
   port to the Microsoft Windows platform as well as extensive
   work on the Basis library (including support for <tt>IntInf.int</tt>).</li>
<li>The SML/NJ source CVS repository has been moved to SourceForge.
  The 
 <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/smlnj">SML/NJ SourceForge
	    project page</a>
 has a link to information about CVS access.  The distribution files
 are also in the process of being moved to SourceForge.  A mirror of 
 the www.smlnj.org is available at the
 <a href="http://smlnj.cs.uchicago.edu">
 University of Chicago</a>. The Bell Labs SML/NJ web site is now obsolete and
 will be replaced with an indirection to www.smlnj.org. [March 10, 2003]</li>
<li>We have switched over to a new mailing list hosted by
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>.  The name of
    the new list is <img src="smlnj-list-logo.jpg" align=center>.
    (To avoid receiving
    to much spam we do not show the name of the mailing list in clear text
    and render it as a JPG image instead.  If spammers start using fancy
    OCR, we give up.)</li>
<li><a href="new.html#110.42">Working version 110.42 available.</a>
    This relatively small but important update (among other things)
    fixes a memory leak problem in CML and provides support for MacOS
    X 10.2.  (We have provided a MacOS <a
    href="/dist/working/110.42/smlnj-macosx.dmg">disk
    image</a> with pre-compiled runtime systems for both MacOS 10.1
    and 10.2 for use by those without developer tools.  See the README
    file within this disk image for details.)
