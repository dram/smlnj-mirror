<h3>What's New</h3>
</a>

<ul>
  <li>[2020-04-21] Version <a href="dist/working/110.97/index.html">110.97</a> is
    released.
    This release is fairly substantial, with a bunch of bug fixes, additional
    documentation, and a large number of changes and additions to the
    <strong>SML/NJ Library</strong>.
    See the <a href="dist/working/110.97/110.97-README.html">README</a>
    for details. <br/>
  </li>
  <li>[2019-12-13] Version <a href="dist/working/110.96/index.html">110.96</a> is
    released.
    This release fixes a number of issues with the 64-bit version; see the
    See the <a href="dist/working/110.96/110.96-README.html">README</a>
    for details. <br/>
  </li>
  <li>[2019-11-09] Version <a href="dist/working/110.95/index.html">110.95</a> is
    released.
    This release fixes some critical bugs.
    See the <a href="dist/working/110.95/110.95-README.html">README</a>
    for details. <br/>
  </li>
  <li>[2019-11-02] New versions of both the <b>macOS</b> and <b>Windows</b>
    installers for the <a href="dist/working/110.94/index.html">110.94</a>
     have been posted.  The <b>macOS</b> installers fix an issue where the
     scripts were looking for a 32-bit version when a 64-bit version had
    been installed.  The Windows installer includes a fix for bug #225 that
    was inadvertently omitted. <br/>
  </li>
  <li>[2019-11-01] New versions of the <a href="dist/working/110.94/index.html">110.94</a>
    installers for <b>macOS</b> were released.  These fix a problem with the wrapper
    scripts having an incorrect path for the installation. <br/>
  </li>
  <li>[2019-10-31] Version <a href="dist/working/110.94/index.html">110.94</a> is
    released.
    This version is the first to support 64-bit platforms; specifically
    64-bit executables on <b>macOS</b> and <b>Linux</b>.
    See the <a href="dist/working/110.94/110.94-README.html">README</a>
    for details. <br/>
  </li>
  <li>[2019-09-05] Version <a href="dist/working/110.93/index.html">110.93</a> is
    released.
    See the <a href="dist/working/110.93/110.93-README.html">README</a>
    for details. <br/>
  </li>
  <li>[2019-08-10] Version <a href="dist/working/110.92/index.html">110.92</a> is
    released.
    See the <a href="dist/working/110.92/110.92-README.html">README</a>
    for details. <br/>
  </li>
  <li>[2019-06-20] Version <a href="dist/working/110.91/index.html">110.91</a> is
    released.
    See the <a href="dist/working/110.91/110.91-README.html">README</a>
    for details. <br/>
  </li>
  <li>[2019-06-12] Version <a href="dist/working/110.90/index.html">110.90</a> is
    released.
    This release completes the switch over to 64-bit file positions by adding
    support for Windows (which was missing in 110.89).
    See the <a href="dist/working/110.90/110.90-README.html">README</a>
    for details. <br/>
  </li>
  <li>[2019-06-01] Version <a href="dist/working/110.89/index.html">110.89</a> is
    released.
    This release is not completely stable, so we recommend sticking with 110.87
    for production work.
    Also, this version does not support Windows.
    See the <a href="dist/working/110.89/110.89-README.html">README</a>
    for details. <br/>
  </li>
  <li>[2019-05-15] Version <a href="dist/working/110.88/index.html">110.88</a> is
    released.
    This release is not completely stable, so we recommend sticking with 110.87
    for production work.
    See the <a href="dist/working/110.88/110.88-README.html">README</a>
    for details. <br/>
  </li>
  <li>[2019-05-03] Version <a href="dist/working/110.87/index.html">110.87</a> is
    released.
    See the <a href="dist/working/110.87/110.87-README.html">README</a>
    for details. <br/>
    Note that Version 110.86 was released on May 2, but was not announced, since
    it was just a stepping stone to get to the 110.87 release.

<strong>A node about version numbers</strong><br/>
A long time ago, we had version numbers like <b>0.93</b>; when we hit <b>0.100</b>,
we dropped the leading zero and switched to <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, etc.
For some reason, when we hit version <b>110</b>, we stopped incrementing
the first number and just bumped up the second (no one remembers why).
We are now approaching version <b>110.100</b>.  At that time, we plan to
switch to a different numbering scheme, where versions will have a major
number determined by the year and a minor number determined by the release
number for that year.  For example, if we have three more releases
this year, then the last release will be number <b>2020.4</b>, since it
will be the fourth release of the year.
</p>

<h3>Support for 64-bit architectures</h3>
<p>
The latest version (<a href="dist/working/110.97/index.html">110.97</a>)
supports 64-bit executables on <b>macOS</b> and <b>Linux</b>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>
    The latest release is  <a href="dist/working/110.97/index.html">110.97</a>;
    we believe that this version is stable, but there have been a lot of low-level
    changes that might have introduced bugs, so if you have any problems with the
    system you should report them and then revert to
    <a href="dist/working/110.87/index.html">110.87</a>.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
    Previous versions are also available through our
    <a href="dist/working/index.html">release history</a> page.
    A history of the changes to the system is also
    <a href="dist/working/110.97/HISTORY.html">available</a>.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
    Signed installers for macOS are available, which install the system
    in <code>/usr/local/smlnj</code>.

    Note that to install <b>SML/NJ</b> on <b>macOS</b> 10.15 Catalina, you will have to
    <b>right-click</b> on the installer package, which should open up a dialog
    box.  Click on the <b>Open</b> button to run the installer.
