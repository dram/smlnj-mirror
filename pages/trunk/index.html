<p><a href="smlnj.html"><strong>Standard ML of New Jersey</strong></a>
(abbreviated <strong>SML/NJ</strong>) is
a compiler for the
<a href="sml97.html"><strong>Standard ML '97</strong></a>
programming language with associated libraries,
tools, and documentation.
SML/NJ is <a href="license.html">free, open source</a> software.
</p>

<h3>Support for 64-bit architectures</h3>
<p>
As of version <a href="dist/working/110.94/index.html">110.94</a>, we now have
support for 64-bit executables on <b>macOS</b> and <b>Linux</b>.
</p>
<p>
Note that to install <b>SML/NJ</b> on <b>macOS</b> 10.15 Catalina, you will have to
<b>right-click</b> on the installer package, which should open up a dialog
box.  Click on the <b>Open</b> button to run the installer.

<h3>Downloads</h3>
</a>
The latest release is  <a href="dist/working/110.96/index.html">110.96</a>;
we believe that this version is stable, but there have been a lot of low-level
changes that might have introduced bugs, so if you have any problems with the
system you should report them and then revert to
<a href="dist/working/110.87/index.html">110.87</a>.
Previous versions are also available through our
<a href="dist/working/index.html">release history</a> page.
A history of the changes to the system is also
<a href="dist/working/110.96/HISTORY.html">available</a>.

<h3>Subversion access</h3>
</a>

Our master source repository is kept on a <a
href="https://www.fusionforge.org">FusionForge</a> server (a successor
to GForge) under <a href="https://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a> control.
We provide anonymous read-only access to the repository, so anyone can
download a snapshot of the most recent sources at any time.

<h3>What's New</h3>
</a>

<ul>
  <li>[11/12/13] Version <a href="dist/working/110.96/index.html">110.96</a> is
    released.
    This release fixes a number of issues with the 64-bit version; see the
    See the <a href="dist/working/110.96/110.96-README.html">README</a>
    for details. <br/>
  </li>
  <li>[11/09/19] Version <a href="dist/working/110.95/index.html">110.95</a> is
    released.
    This release fixes some critical bugs.
    See the <a href="dist/working/110.95/110.95-README.html">README</a>
    for details. <br/>
  </li>
  <li>[11/02/19] New versions of both the <b>macOS</b> and <b>Windows</b>
    installers for the <a href="dist/working/110.94/index.html">110.94</a>
     have been posted.  The <b>macOS</b> installers fix an issue where the
     scripts were looking for a 32-bit version when a 64-bit version had
    been installed.  The Windows installer includes a fix for bug #225 that
    was inadvertently omitted. <br/>
  </li>
  <li>[11/01/19] New versions of the <a href="dist/working/110.94/index.html">110.94</a>
    installers for <b>macOS</b> were released.  These fix a problem with the wrapper
    scripts having an incorrect path for the installation. <br/>
  </li>
  <li>[10/31/19] Version <a href="dist/working/110.94/index.html">110.94</a> is
    released.
    This version is the first to support 64-bit platforms; specifically
    64-bit executables on <b>macOS</b> and <b>Linux</b>.
    See the <a href="dist/working/110.94/110.94-README.html">README</a>
    for details. <br/>
  </li>
  <li>[09/05/19] Version <a href="dist/working/110.93/index.html">110.93</a> is
    released.
    See the <a href="dist/working/110.93/110.93-README.html">README</a>
    for details. <br/>
  </li>
  <li>[08/10/19] Version <a href="dist/working/110.92/index.html">110.92</a> is
    released.
    See the <a href="dist/working/110.92/110.92-README.html">README</a>
    for details. <br/>
  </li>
  <li>[06/20/19] Version <a href="dist/working/110.91/index.html">110.91</a> is
    released.
    See the <a href="dist/working/110.91/110.91-README.html">README</a>
    for details. <br/>
  </li>
  <li>[06/12/19] Version <a href="dist/working/110.90/index.html">110.90</a> is
    released.
    This release completes the switch over to 64-bit file positions by adding
    support for Windows (which was missing in 110.89).
    See the <a href="dist/working/110.90/110.90-README.html">README</a>
    for details. <br/>
  </li>
  <li>[06/01/19] Version <a href="dist/working/110.89/index.html">110.89</a> is
    released.
    This release is not completely stable, so we recommend sticking with 110.87
    for production work.
    Also, this version does not support Windows.
    See the <a href="dist/working/110.89/110.89-README.html">README</a>
    for details. <br/>
  </li>
  <li>[05/15/19] Version <a href="dist/working/110.88/index.html">110.88</a> is
    released.
    This release is not completely stable, so we recommend sticking with 110.87
    for production work.
    See the <a href="dist/working/110.88/110.88-README.html">README</a>
    for details. <br/>
  </li>
  <li>[05/03/19] Version <a href="dist/working/110.87/index.html">110.87</a> is
    released.
    See the <a href="dist/working/110.87/110.87-README.html">README</a>
    for details. <br/>
    Note that Version 110.86 was released on May 2, but was not announced, since
    it was just a stepping stone to get to the 110.87 release.
