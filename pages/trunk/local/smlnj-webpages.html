    <h1>Updating smlnj web pages</h1>

The smlnj web site is maintained as an svn repository with URL
<pre>
   https://smlnj-gforge.cs.uchicago.edu/svn/smlnj/pages/trunk
</pre>
The actual server page sources are located at
<pre>
   /stage/web_static/smlnj/htdocs
</pre>
on the UofC servers. This is a working directory checked out
from the repository mentioned above.
<p>
If you want to edit the smlnj pages, you should check out your
own working copy of the pages/trunk project, make your edits
in your working copy, and then commit them to the svn repository.
<p>
Your changes can then be made visible at the main
<a href="http://www.smlnj.org">www.smlnj.org</a> URL, which is
an alias for 
<a href="http://smlnj.cs.uchicago.edu">smlnj.cs.uchicago.edu</a>,
by doing an svn update in the htdocs directory mentioned above.
<p>
<blockquote>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Certain distribution-specific files are not in
the repository. In particular, dist/working/110.xx/NOTES, which
contains some documentation files like MACOSXINSTALL. These files
have to be edited directly in the corresponding site source directories.
</blockquote>
<p>
This page and other local developer documentation are found in
the <tt>local</tt> subdirectory of the pages directory. This local
site is password protected (user: smlnj, password: semantix),
and there are no links to it from the main smlnj web site.
<p>
<blockquote>
Formerly the web server for www.smlnj.org was at sourceforge, and
the directory containing the web pages was located at:
<pre>
   /home/groups/s/sm/smlnj/htdocs
</pre>
But this old version is no longer maintained.
