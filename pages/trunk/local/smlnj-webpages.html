    <h1>Updating smlnj web pages</h1>

[Matthias Blume, 11/7/06]
<blockquote>
I replaced the contents of
<pre>
   /stage/web_static/smlnj/htdocs
</pre>
on the UofC server by checking out
<pre>
   https://smlnj-gforge.cs.uchicago.edu/svn/smlnj/pages/trunk
</pre>
The old CVS-based content is still available in a sub-directory
named old-site-from-cvs.  We should remove this once we have
confirmed that everything works ok.  Once this is the case,
we should do the same with the "main" site (currently hosted
by SourceForge) to avoid consistency problems.
</blockquote>

If you want to edit the smlnj pages, you should check out your
own working copy of the pages/trunk directory, make your edits
in your working copy, and then commit them to the svn repository.
<p>
Your changes can can be made visible at the
<a href="http://www.smlnj.edu">main UofC smlnj site</a>
(also available at URL http://smlnj.cs.uchicago.edu) by doing an svn update in the
htdocs directory mentioned above.

Formerly the web server for www.smlnj.org was at sourceforge, and
the path for the directory containing the web pages was
<pre>
   /home/groups/s/sm/smlnj/htdocs
</pre>
