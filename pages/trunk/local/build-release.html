    <h1>Building a Release</h1>
This is a very preliminary rough draft of a HOWTO page on building
a release of SML/NJ.

The main steps in building a release are as follows:
<ul>
<li>
Create the directory to contain the release.  E.g. in a working copy
of the pages project, svn add directory dist/working/110.n, where n is
the release number. Then commit the change, and update the web-site
copy of the pages project at /stages/web_static/smlnj/htdocs.
</li>
<li>
Write 110.n-README.txt and 110.n-README.html files and commit them.
Also update NOTES/HISTORY file.
</li>
<li>
Run the allcross script in base/system to build boot directories for 
all the architectures and create tarballs from them. Copy these
tarballs to the dist/working/110.n directory created in the first step.
</li>
<li>
Export source directories and create tarballs and transfer them to
the distribution directory.
</li>
<li>
Create .dmg file for Mac OS X installation, and a Windows .zip file.
(Details?). Add these to the distribution directory.
</li>
<li>
Add a link to dist/working/110.n/110.n-README.html to
dist/index.html.
</li>
</ul>
