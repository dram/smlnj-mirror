<h2>Adding a new developer account</h2>
<ul>
<li> Log in to the GForge site; note that only administrators are
  allowed to register new users.
  </li>
<li> On the white tab list at the top click "Admin".
  </li>
<li> Under "User Maintenance" choose "Register a New User" and fill in the form with a username, password and e-mail address.
</li>
<li> The new account holder will receive a confirmation e-mail (at the
specified e-mail address) that the account has been created. He/she
should click on the verification link in the e-mail and log in as the
new user.
</li>
<ul>
<p>  
Back in the administrative session the new user should be added to
  (e.g.) the SML/NJ project:
<ul>  
<li>
  Go to the SML/NJ project and click on the Admin tab.
  (https://smlnj-gforge.cs.uchicago.edu/project/admin/?group_id=15).
</li>
<li> At the bottom of the "Group Members" table on the right, click
"Add Users From List".
</li>
<li> Find the user name by clicking on the button labeled by the
first letter of the name. Then click on the "Add User" box at the
right end of the line.
<li> Choose an appropriate role, e.g. "Senior Developer".
</li>
<li> Now the new user has access to the site. It may take an hour
before he/she
has check-in access to the SML/NJ SVN tree.
</li>
</ul>
