    <h1>SML/NJ SVN Howto</h1>

The repository now hosts a number of semi-independent toplevel trees:
<ul>
<li>admin -- repository administration</li>
<li>pages -- the web site</li>
<li>sml -- a rump of what used to be the entire SML/NJ source tree;
it should be checked out as "base" (see below)</li>
<li>config -- shell scripts etc. for configuration and installation</li>
<li>MLRISC -- the MLRISC library</li>
<li>ckit -- the CKIT library</li>
<li>nlffi -- the NLFFI sources consisting of the runtime library (lib) and the generator tool (gen)</li>
</ul>
... and so forth

<p>
To compile and install SML/NJ, one needs to create a root directory (of arbitrary name, let's call it "root" for the purpose of this explanation) and then populate it with various sub-trees by checking out parts of this repository (and potentially other repositories).

The default layout populates root with:
<ul>
<li>config
<li>base
<li>smlnj-lib
<li>MLRISC
<li>ml-yacc
<li>ml-lex
<li>nlffi
<li>ckit
<li>cml
<li>eXene
<li>ml-burg
<li>lexgen
<li>ml-lpt
<li>heap2asm
<li>smlnj-c
</ul>
(Not all of these trees are always necessary.)

<p>
Let gf=https://smlnj-gforge.cs.uchicago.edu/svn
and smlnj=$gf/smlnj

<p>
By default, a tree T is obtained by performing
<pre>
   svn co $smlnj/T/trunk T
</pre>
There currently are two exceptions to this:
<pre>
   svn co $smlnj/sml/trunk base
   svn co $gf/ml-lpt/ml-lpt ml-lpt
</pre>
To simplify the creation of the default layout one can use the scripts in $gf/admin. Do:
<pre>
   svn co $smlnj/admin admin
</pre>
and put the admin directory in your shell's PATH. To create the default layout, you can now run
<pre>
   checkout-all.sh root
</pre>
which creates the root directory and populates it as described above. Without the optional argument, checkout-all.sh populates the current directory.
<p>
To perform svn update on all subtrees, run
<pre>
   refresh-all.sh
</pre>
from within root. Similarly, to perform svn stat on all subtrees, use stat-all.sh.
<p>
Commits should be done on a per-tree basis by hand.


<h3> Recipies </h3>

The following are more detailed recipies for performing typical tasks.
<p>
<h4>
I. Preparation
</h4>

Assume that the path for your local smlnj development directory
is the value of shell variable <code>SMLDEV</code> (e.g. in my case,
<code>SMLDEV=~/sml/Dev</code>).

<ol>
<li>define some shell variables
<pre>
  $ export gf=https://smlnj-gforge.cs.uchicago.edu/svn
  $ export smlnj=$gf/smlnj
</pre>
</li>
<li>In your <code>$SMLDEV</code> directory, create a directory gf
<pre>
  $ cd $SMLDEV
  $ mkdir gf
</pre>

<li>Go to gf and checkout the admin directory
<pre>
  $ cd gf
  $ svn co $smlnj/admin
</pre>
This creates subdirectory gf/admin containing some shell
scripts to automate checking out the full source code, checking
status, etc.
</li>

<li>Add $SMLDEV/gf/admin to your shell PATH.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Of course, you could put this checkout somewhere else, such in your
personal bin file, or in /usr/local/bin if you have permission. In
this case, step 4 would not be necessary.


<h4>II. To check out a working copy of the trunk smlnj code and build the compiler
</h4>
<ol>
<li>Assuming you are in your development directory, create a working
directory and check out the required top level subdirectories. This
can be done in one step by giving checkout-all.sh a directory name
as an argument, e.g.:
<pre>
  $ checkout-all.sh smlnj
</pre>
</li>
<li>Change to the new working directory and run the install script:
<pre>
  $ cd smlnj
  $ config/install.sh
</pre>
</li>
<li>If you do not have an existing ml-yacc in your <code>PATH</code>,
then this may fail because of the order in which svn checks out
certain ml-yacc source files. In this case, you can recover by
executing
<pre>
  $ touch ml-yacc/src/yacc.grm.sig ml-yacc/src/yacc.grm.sml
</pre>
to make these younger than ml-yacc/src/yacc.grm.  This is a temporary
problem until the build scripts are modified to take care of this.
</li>
</ol>

<h4>III. To check out a private development branch</h4>
<p>
In this example, the branch is named <code>primop-branch-3</code>, and is based
on the top-level repository directory <code>$smlnj/sml</code>.

<ol>
<li>To check what branches exist under a top-level directory, like
<code>sml</code> (= <code>base</code>), do
<pre>
  $ svn list $gf/sml/branches/
</pre>
</li>
<li>Create target directory, here called primop3, and change to it.
<pre>
  $ mkdir primop3
  $ cd primop3
</pre>
</li>
<li>In the target primop3 directory do
<pre>
  $ svn co https://smlnj-gforge.cs.uchicago.edu/svn/smlnj/sml/branches/primop-branch-3
</pre>
or (given the definition of shell variable <code>smlnj</code> from part I above) 
<pre>
  $ svn co $smlnj/sml/branches/primop-branch-3 base
</pre>
This checks out the primop-branch-3 code for the sml directory, locally renamed
as "base".
</li>
<li>Run checkout-all.sh to get the rest of the source code (assuming gf/admin
has been added to the PATH)
<pre>
  $ checkout-all.sh
</pre>
</li>
<li>Run config/install.sh to build the compiler.
</li>
</ol>
