<h1>
SML/NJ Chicago Developers Site
</h1>
This is a password protected web site serving the local Hyde Park
SML/NJ development community (and potentially all active SML/NJ
developers). The source files for this web site are found in the
directory /stage/web_static/smlnj/htdocs/local on UofC CS Dept
servers. Feel free to edit these pages to add or correct information,
but make sure any new or changed files are group sml and group
writable.

<p>
We are transitioning the SML/NJ project from sourceforge to a local
gforge server. This page will provide documentation on how to use the
local vacilities.
