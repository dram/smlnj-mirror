   </CENTER>

<UL 

    <font color=#ff0000>mlriscTiger</font> is an MLRISC based compiler
    compiler written in ML for a Pascal-like language called <font
    color=#ff0000>Tiger</font>. The language is used as the working
    project in the book <EM>Modern Compiler Implementation: Basic
    Techniques</EM> by Andrew Appel. The MLRISC technology replaces
    all the back end phases starting from instruction selection and
    targets the DEC Alpha, HPPA, and Intel x86.  mlriscTiger is a good
    way to learn about MLRISC as it is small and tractable, yet
    non-trivial example.

    <p> The distribution contains all the sources (including MLRISC)
    except the front end sources which cannot be distributed directly,
    but can be obtained by sending me <A
    HREF="mailto:george@research.bell-labs.com">email</A>.

    <p> mlriscTiger has been tested with the latest release of SML/NJ
    (Version 110.0.3) but should also work with newer versions.
