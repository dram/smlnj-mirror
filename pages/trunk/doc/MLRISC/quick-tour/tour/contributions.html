    The optimizations provided by MLRISC are at a similar level to
    those performed by the Impact compiler; several target back ends
    exist (Dec Alpha, HPPA, x86, and PPC); but more importantly, the
    framework has been demonstrated in real use for languages with
    radically different execution models.  These include:

    <p>
    The strength of MLRISC lies in the ability to easily create high
    quality code generator for each of these systems. For example:
    <p>
    <dl>
      <dt> <FONT COLOR=#005500>Tiger: </FONT> <dd> Has an execution
      model very similar to C with stack allocated activation frames,
      and also maintains static and dynamic chains to support lexical
      scoping.
<p>
      <dt><FONT COLOR=#005500> TIL:</FONT> <dd> Is similar to C in its
      use of activation frames, however it uses a <I>typed
      intermediate language</I> that supports <I>almost tag-free</I>
      garbage collection.  This has severe implications on the
      interaction of spilling and garbage collection. The set of live
      variables and their locations, be it registers or frame slots,
      is recorded in a trace table for a specific program point. When
      spilling occurs, it is necessary to adjust some of these trace
      tables to reflect the new locations of live variables.
<p>
      <dt> <FONT COLOR=#005500>SML/NJ:</FONT> <dd> Has no runtime
      stack, but stores all execution context in a garbage collected
      heap. This arrangement imposes special requirements for spilling
      registers. SML/NJ also does <I>dynamic linking</I> --- that is
      to say, no use is made of a conventional linker, but machine
      code is generated directly and linked into the interactive
      environment, dynamically.
        </dl>
    
<p>
  It is not uncommon for any of these systems to store special global
  values in dedicated registers, and use their own parameter passing
  and callee-save conventions. In any language that supports garbage
  collection, there is a subtle interaction between global code motion
  past garbage collection points that must also be dealt with.
