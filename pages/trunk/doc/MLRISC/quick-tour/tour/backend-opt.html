  Once MLRisc trees have been generated, they are passed into a module
  that generates a flowgraph of target machine instructions. Again,
  this module and all subsequent optimization phases have been
  specialized to the front end.  <img alt="Back end optimizations"
  align=right src=pictures/jpeg/optimization.jpg> Nearly all
  instruction selection modules provided by MLRISC use a simple tree
  pattern matching algorithm rather than the more heavy weight BURG
  tools --- including the x86 <font color=#580000> It is important to
  emphasis that all optimizations are performed on the flowgraph of
  target machine instructions and <EM>not</EM> MLRisc
  instructions. </font> There is complete flexibility in the order,
  and nature of the optimizations performed.
