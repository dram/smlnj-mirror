<UL>&nbsp;<I> Writing native code generators for modern
processors with increasing hardware support for instruction level
parallelism is a significant investment. Unfortunately it is difficult
to reuse this investment for other architectures, and even more
difficult to reuse for other source language compilers. The MLRISC
framework has been successfully retargeted to multiple architectures
and deals elegantly with the special requirements imposed by the
execution model of different highl-level source languages. Nearly all
aspects of back end code generation and advanced optimizations such as
global register allocation, profile driven superblock and percolation
style scheduling come for free.

<P>
These page are intended to give a high
level overview of the framework with details deferred to a technical
user manual under preparation.
