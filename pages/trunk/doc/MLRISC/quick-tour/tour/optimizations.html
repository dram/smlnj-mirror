  MLRISC assumes that all high level optimizations (target
  independent) have already been performed. This includes things like
  inlining, array dependence analysis, and array bounds check
  elimination.  The target dependent optimizations that remain include
  register allocation, scheduling and traditional optimizations to
  support scheduling. 

  <h2> <font color=#aa0000> Register allocation</font></h2>
  
  MLRISC includes a state-of-the-art graph-coloring based register
  allocator that has an aggressive algorithm for copy-propagation. The
  latter guarantees to eliminate copy instructions without introducing
  spills.

  <p> Spills in the register allocator are under the control of the
client via call-backs to the front end. Where to spill registers and
the associated information that must be maintained is client specific
and varies with the compiler. 

  <h2> <font color=#aa0000> Scheduling </font></h2>
  Several algorithms for acyclic global scheduling are provided. These
include:

  <ul>
    <li> Superblock,
    <li> a variant of Bernstein/Rodeh, and
    <li> Percolation based scheduling.
  </ul>

These algorithms tend to be quite complex and require a large number
of support data structures and analysis. These include data structures
such as:

  <ul>
    <li> dominator/post dominator trees,
    <li> control dependency graphs, and 
    <li> data dependency graphs.
 </ul>

Support analysis and optimization include:

  <ul>
    <li> constant propagation,
    <li> global value numbering,
    <li> loop invariant hoisting,
    <li> incremental liveness, 
    <li> partial redundancy elimination, and
    <li> parameterized form of abstract interpretation.
  </ul>
