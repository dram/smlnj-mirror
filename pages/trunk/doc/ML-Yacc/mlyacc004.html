<H2>4&nbsp;&nbsp; The lexical analyzer</H2>Let the name for
the parser given in the <TT>%name</TT> declaration be denoted by {n} and
the specification file name be denoted by {spec name}
The parser generator creates a functor named {n}LrValsFun for
the values needed for a particular parser. This functor is placed
in {spec name}.sml. This
functor contains a structure
Tokens which allows you to construct terminals from the appropriate
values. The structure has a function for each terminal that takes a tuple
consisting of the value for the terminal (if there is any), a leftmost
position for the terminal, and a rightmost position for the terminal and
constructs the terminal from these values.<BR>
<BR>
A signature for the structure Tokens is created and placed in the ``.sig''
file created by ML-Yacc. This signature is {n}_TOKENS,
 where {n} is
the name given in the parser specification. A signature
{n}_LRVALS is created for the structure produced by
applying {n}LrValsFun.<BR>
<BR>
Use the signature {n}_TOKENS to create a functor for the
lexical analyzer which takes the structure Tokens as an argument. The
signature {n}_TOKENS
will not change unless the <TT>%term</TT> declaration in a
specification is altered by adding terminals or
changing the types of terminals. You do not need to recompile
the lexical analyzer functor each time the specification for
the parser is changed if the
signature {n}_TOKENS does not change.<BR>
<BR>
If you are using ML-Lex to create the lexical analyzer, you
can turn the lexer structure into a functor using the
<TT>%header</TT> declaration.
<TT>%header</TT> allows the user to define the header for a structure body.<BR>
<BR>
If the name of the parser in the specification were Calc, you
would add this declaration to the specification for the lexical 
analyzer:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE><TT>
%header (functor CalcLexFun(structure Tokens : Calc_TOKENS))
</TT></PRE><TT>
</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>You must define the following in the user definitions section:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE><TT>
type pos
</TT></PRE><TT>
</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
This is the type of position values for terminals. This type
must be the same as the one declared in the specification for
the grammar. Note, however, that this type is not available
in the Tokens structure that parameterizes the lexer functor.<BR>
<BR>
You must include the following code in the user definitions section of
the ML-Lex specification:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE><TT>
type svalue = Tokens.svalue
type ('a,'b) token = ('a,'b) Tokens.token
type lexresult  = (svalue,pos) token
</TT></PRE><TT>
</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>These types are used to give lexers signatures.<BR>
<BR>
You may use a lexer constructed using ML-Lex with the <TT>%arg</TT>
declaration, but you must follow special instructions for tying the parser
and lexer together.
