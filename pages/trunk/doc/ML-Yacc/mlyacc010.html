<H3>10.1&nbsp;&nbsp; Multiple start symbols</H3>
To have multiple start symbols, define a dummy token for each
start symbol. Then define a start symbol which derives the
multiple start symbols with dummy tokens placed in front of
them. When you start the parser you must place a dummy token
on the front of the lexer stream to select a start symbol
from which to begin parsing.<BR>
<BR>
Assuming that you have followed the naming conventions used before,
create the lexer using the makeLexer function in the {n}Parser structure.
Then, place the dummy token on the front of the lexer:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
val dummyLexer =
    {n}Parser.Stream.cons
        ({n}LrVals.Tokens.{dummy token name}
                 ({dummy lineno},{dummy lineno}),
        lexer)
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
You have to pass a Tokens structure to the lexer. This Tokens structure
contains functions which construct tokens from values and line numbers.
So to create your dummy token just apply the appropriate token constructor
function from this Tokens structure to a value (if there is one) and the
line numbers. This is exactly what you do in the lexer to construct tokens.<BR>
<BR>
Then you must place the dummy token on the front of your lex stream.
The structure {n}Parser contains a structure Stream which implements
lazy streams. So you just cons the dummy token on to stream returned
by makeLexer.

<H3>10.2&nbsp;&nbsp; Functorizing things further</H3>You may wish to functorize things even further. Two possibilities
are turning the lexer and parser structures into closed functors,
that is, functors which do not refer to types or values defined
outside their body or outside their parameter structures (except
for pervasive types and values), and creating a functor which
encapsulates the code necessary to invoke the parser.<BR>
<BR>
Use the <TT>%header</TT> declarations in ML-Lex and ML-Yacc to create
closed functors. See section&nbsp;<A HREF="mlyacc002.html#optional-def">2.4</A> of this manual
and section 4 of the manual for ML-Lex for complete descriptions of these
declarations. If you do this, you should also parameterize these
structures by the types of line numbers. The type will be an
abstract type, so you will also need to define all the valid
operations on the type. The signature INTERFACE, defined below,
shows one possible signature for a structure defining the line
number type and associated operations.<BR>
<BR>
If you wish to encapsulate the code necessary to invoke the
parser, your functor generally will have form:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
functor Encapsulate(
     structure Parser : PARSER
     structure Interface : INTERFACE
         sharing type Parser.arg = Interface.arg
         sharing type Parser.pos = Interface.pos
         sharing type Parser.result = ...
     structure Tokens : {parser name}_TOKENS
         sharing type Tokens.token = Parser.Token.token
         sharing type Tokens.svalue = Parser.svalue) =
  struct
        ...
  end
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>The signature INTERFACE, defined below, is a possible signature for
a structure
defining the types
of line numbers and arguments (types pos and arg, respectively)
along with operations for them. You need this structure
because
these types will be abstract types inside the body of your
functor.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
signature INTERFACE = 
sig
   type pos
   val line : pos ref
   val reset : unit -&gt; unit
   val next : unit -&gt; unit
   val error : string * pos * pos -&gt; unit

   type arg
   val nothing : arg
end
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>The directory example/fol contains a sample parser in which
the code for tying together the lexer and parser has been
encapsulated in a functor.<BR>
