<H1>Standard ML of New Jersey Interactive System</H1>
<blockquote>
This section explains some of the basic elements of using the Standard
ML of New Jersey compiler as an interactive system into which you
enter declarations and expressions or load code from source files.
This is the most accessible mode of using the compiler, but for any
programs of nontrivial size we recommend that the <a href="CM/index.html">
Compilation Manager</a> be used to organize the compilation process.
<p>
We assume below that you are using the compiler under Unix.  The
behavior will be somewhat different under MS Windows or the Macintosh
OS.

<h2>Running Standard ML</h2>

   Type ``<code>sml</code>'' from the shell.  This puts you into the
   interactive system.  The top level prompt is ``-'', and the
   secondary prompt (printed when input is incomplete) is ``=''.
   If you get the secondary prompt when you don't expect it,
   typing ``<code>;</code> <i>return</i>'' will often complete your input, or
   typing your interrupt character (e.g., control-C) 
   will cancel your input and return to the ML top level.
<p>
   If ``<code>sml</code>'' doesn't work, ask where <code>sml</code> has
   been installed on your machine and use the appropriate path name or
   redefine your PATH environment variable.

<h2>Interactive input</h2>

   Input to the top level interpreter (i.e., declarations and
   expressions) must be terminated by a semicolon (and carriage
   return) before the system will evaluate it.  The system then prints
   out a response indicating the effect of the evaluation.
   Expressions are treated as implicit declarations of a standard
   variable <code>it</code>.  For example,

<table>
<tr><td><code>- 3;</code><td><i>user input after prompt</i>
<tr><td><code>val it  = 3 : int<td><i>system response</i>
</table>

   This means that the value of the last top level expression evaluated
   can be referred to using the variable ``<code>it</code>.''

<h2>Interrupting compilation or execution</h2>

Typing the interrupt character (typically control-C)
should interrupt the compiler and return you
to top level.

<h2>Exiting the interactive system.</h2>

Typing control-D (EOF) at top level will cause an exit to the shell
(or the parent process from which <code>sml</code> was run).  One can also terminate
by calling <code>OS.Process.exit(OS.Process.success)</code>.

<h2>Loading ML source text from a file</h2>

The function <code>use: string -> unit</code> interprets its argument as a
file name relative to <code>sml</code>'s current directory and loads the text
from that file as though it had been typed in.  This should normally
be executed at top level, but the loaded files can also contain calls
of <code>use</code> to recursively load other files.  It is a bad idea to call
<code>use</code> within an expression or declaration, because the effects are
not well-defined.
<p>
For industrial-strength multi-module software systems, the 
the <a href="CM">Compilation Manager</a>
is more appropriate than <code>use</code>.

<!--
<h2>Saving an image of the system</h2>

Use the function <code>exportML: string -> bool</code> to save an image of the
current <code>sml</code> system (including the environment that you have
built) in a file.  
-->

<h2>Error messages</h2>

The compiler attempts to recover from syntactic errors so that it can
also produce semantic (type-checking) errors during the same
compilation.  Syntactic error recovery is more accurate for source
files loaded by <code>use</code> or CM than it is from declarations typed
directly into the interactive system -- this is because lookahead is
not possible when text is entered one line at a time.
<p>
When compiling files, the error messages include line numbers and
character positions within the line.  For example:
<pre>
- if true
= then 5 true
= else 6;
std_in:7.6-7.11 Error: operator is not a function
  operator: int
  in expression:
    5 true
- 
</pre>
Here the location information <code>std_in:7.6-7.11</code> indicates that the
erroneous expression ``<code>5 true</code>'' occupies characters 6 through 11
of the 7th line of input from <code>std_in</code>.  For simple syntactic
errors this position information is usually accurate or perhaps off by
just one line.  For some classes of errors the line numbers may not be very
useful, because they delineate a potentially large declaration
containing the error.  If the error occurs in a file being loaded by
<code>use</code>, the line numbers will refer to lines in the file being
loaded.
<p>
There are a number of different forms of type error message, and it
may require some practice before you become adept at interpreting
them.  The most common form indicates a mismatch between the type of a
function (or operator) and its argument (or operand).
A representation of the offending expression is usually included, but
this is an image of the internal abstract syntax for the expression
and may differ significantly from the original source code.  For
instance, an expression ``<code>if </code>e1<code> then </code>e2<code> else </code>e3''
is represented internally as a <code>case</code> expression over a boolean value: 
``$<code>case </code> e1 <code> of true => </code> e2 <code> | false => </code> e3.''
<p>
All the error messages produced by SML/NJ are documented in the
<a href="errors.html"><strong>SML/NJ Error and Warning Messages</strong></a> page.

<h2>Compiler interface</h2>

Most users will interact with the compiler by loading code via the
<code>use</code> command or under control of the 
<a href="CM/index.html"><i>Compilation Manager</i></a>.
However, some control of individual compiler phases is possible
through the
<a href="Compiler/pages/control.html"><code>Compiler.Control</code></a>
structure.

<h2>Printing</h2>

The structure
<a href="Compiler/pages/printcontrol.html"><code>Compiler.Control.Print</code></a>
contains several useful flags and functions with which you can control
or redirect compiler error, diagnostic, and result messages. 
Among other things, there is a variable <code>printDepth</code> that
controls the depth of printing of large structured values.

<h2>Interacting with the operating system</h2>

The structures <code>IO</code>, <code>OS</code>, and others contain functions
for such tasks as executing other programs from within <code>sml</code>
and changing the current directory.  These are documented in
<a href="basis/index.html">
The Standard ML Basis Library</a> manual.

<h2>Emacs support</h2>
The directory contrib/emacs contains
<a href="mailto:mjm@dcs.ed.ac.uk"> Matthew J. Morley's</a> 
<a href="Emacs/sml-mode.html">sml-mode</a> package that supports editing SML
source code and interacting with <code>sml</code> under GNU emacs.
The latest version of the sml-mode package is available at 
<a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~monnier/elisp/">
http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~monnier/elisp/</a>.
