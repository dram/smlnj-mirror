<H1>Object Language Embedding with Quote/Antiquote</h1>
<blockquote>
Standard ML is often used to implement another language <i>L</i>,
for example, 
the syntax of the HOL logic in <tt>hol90</tt> or the syntax of CCS for the
Concurrency Workbench. Typically, one defines the 
abstract syntax of <i>L</i> by a <tt>datatype</tt> declaration. Then useful
functions over the datatype can be defined (such as finding the free
variables of a formula when <i>L</i> is a logic). Soon afterwards, one
concludes that concrete syntax is easier for humans to read than
abstract syntax, and so writes a parser and prettyprinter for <i>L</i>.
<p>
In the situation just outlined, ML is called the 
<i>metalanguage</i>, and <i>L</i> is called the <i>object language</i>, or 
OL. (Edinburgh/INRIA/Cambridge ML, the precursor to Standard ML, was
originally a programming metalanguage for a particular object language,
the LCF logic.)  The purpose of a quotation/antiquotation mechanism
is to allow one to embed expressions in the object language's
concrete syntax inside of ML programs, and to mix the object
language expressions with ML expressions.

<h3>Quotation and Antiquotation</h3>

The quote/antiquote mechanism is enabled by setting 
<pre>
Compiler.Control.quotation : bool ref
</pre>
to true.  Then the backquote character <tt>`</tt>
ceases to be legal in symbolic identifiers, and takes on a special meaning.
<p>
A <i>quotation</i> is a special form of literal expression that
represents the concrete syntax of an OL phrase. The backquote character
<tt>`</tt> is used to delimit quotations.
<p>
For a running example, suppose our OL is a simple propositional logic
with propositions represented as values of abstract type <tt>prop</tt>.
We might wish to write propositional expressions such as <tt>A/\B/\C</tt>.
<p>
The most common approximation to quotation is strings. This is not
pleasant at times, especially when dealing with backslashes and
newlines. Still, strings are bearable. Strings are not adequate,
however, for the following idea.
<p>
The ML-OL relationship invites a notion of <i>antiquotation</i>: the
temporary abandonment of parsing so that an ML value can be spliced into
the middle of a quotation. Operations like this have cropped up under
various names in various places: antiquote is due to Milner; Quine had a
version called <i>quasi-quotation</i> in his 1940 book; 
Carnap used a notation much like it. It also closely resembles
the Lisp <i>backquote</i> facility.
<p>
Using backquote, we write

<pre>
- val f = `A /\ B \/ C`;
<i>val f = [QUOTE "A /\\ B /\\ C"] : 'a SMLofNJ.frag list</i>
</pre>
The compiler interprets this as a list of "fragments", 
using the <a href="../SMLofNJ/pages/smlnj.html#SIG:SML_OF_NJ.frag:TY:SPEC">frag</a>
data type from the SMLofNJ structure:

<pre>
structure SMLofNJ = struct
  . . .
  datatype 'a frag = QUOTE of string | ANTIQUOTE of 'a
end
</pre>
<p>
More commonly, we
invoke an OL parser to parse, enforce precedence, etc.
By naming the parser something concise, such as <tt>%</tt>, we
can use the syntax

<pre>
- val % = my_proposition_parser;
<i>val % : prop frag -> prop</i>
- val p = %`A /\ B \/ C`;
<i>val p = -: prop</i>
</pre>
<p>
An antiquote is written as a caret <tt>^<tt>
followed by either an SML identifier or a parenthesized SML expression.
Antiquotation can be used to conveniently express <i>contexts</i>, which
are often used as a descriptive tool for syntax. A context could be
defined as a function taking a <tt>prop</tt> and directly placing it at a
location in a quotation.

<pre>
- fun foo a = %`^a ==> A`;
<i>val foo : prop -> prop</i>
</pre>

In this case, <tt>foo p</tt> would denote the same proposition as
<pre>
    %`(A /\ B \/ C) ==> A`
</pre>
<p>
Antiquotations can have nested quotations (which may contain antiquotes
of their own, etc.):
<pre>
- let val K x y = x
      val I x = x
  in 
  %`A /\ ^(K (%`B`) (I (%`C`)))
      \/ C`
      end;
</pre>
gives the same <tt>prop</tt> as that denoted by <tt>p</tt>. We note in
passing that the power of the OL parser is completely up to its author:
for example, in the framework offered here, one could write an OL
``parser'' for Scheme that parses program plus arguments, evaluates the
program on the arguments, and finally prints the returned value.

<h3>Implementation of OL parsers</h3>

A concrete syntax quotation is mapped by the SML compiler into a
<tt>frag list</tt>. Intuitively, a <tt>frag</tt> is a contiguous part of a
quotation: <tt>`A /\ B`</tt> maps to <tt>[ QUOTE "A /\\ B" ]</tt>
while <tt>`^x /\ ^y`</tt> maps to
<pre>
[QUOTE "",ANTIQUOTE x, QUOTE "/\\", ANTIQUOTE y, QUOTE ""]
</pre>
(Note that the names <tt>frag</tt>, <tt>QUOTE</tt>, and <tt>ANTIQUOTE</tt>
need to be qualified by the SMLofNJ structure-id, in practice.)
<p>
In this approach, the value of a quotation has type <tt>ol frag list</tt> where
<tt>ol</tt> is the type of object language expressions; the type
of the OL parser is <tt>ol frag list -> ol</tt>.
<p>
The OL parser (in our example, <tt>%</tt>) must handle these lists
and insert the antiquoted ML values in the right places.

<h3>CAVEATS</h3>
Often one wants to parse stratified languages, such as first order
logic, or typed lambda calculus, which requires a trick. Also, there is
a bit of trickery when one wants to deal with ML-Yacc and ML-Lex,
especially when functorizing the parser.
