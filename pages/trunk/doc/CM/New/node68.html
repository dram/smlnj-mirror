11.2.2 Adding a class and its rule</A>
</H3>

<P>
The interface to add arbitrary classes is the routine <TT> 
Tools.registerClass</TT>:

<P>
 
<PRE>

  val registerClass : class * rule -&gt; unit
</PRE>

<P>
Here, type <TT> class</TT> is simply synonymous to <TT> string</TT>; a class
string is the name of the class to be registered.  It must not contain
upper-case letters:

<P>
 
<PRE>

  type class = string
</PRE>

<P>
Type <TT> rule</TT> is a function type.  It describes the rule function
that CM will invoke for every member of the new class. The rule
function is responsible for invoking the auxiliary mechanism necessary
to bring its targets up-to-date.  The function result of the rule
function describes to CM what the targets are.  Thus, the function
maps the <EM> specification</EM> of the given member to its (partial) <EM> 
expansion</EM>:

<P>
 
<PRE>

  type rule =
    { spec: spec,
      native2pathmaker: string -&gt; pathmaker,
      context: rulecontext,
      defaultClassOf: fnspec -&gt; class option } -&gt;
    partial_expansion
</PRE>

<P>
The specification <TT> spec</TT> consists of the name of the member
together with a function to produce its corresponding abstract
path (should that be necessary), the member's optional class (in case
it had been given explicitly), its tool options, and a boolean flag
that tells whether this member was the result of another tool:

<P>
 
<PRE>

  type spec = { name: string,
                mkpath: pathmaker,
                class: class option,
                opts: toolopts option,
                derived: bool }
</PRE>

<P>
 
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>name:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The name is the verbatim member string from the
description file.  Be sure not to use this string directly as a file
name (although some tools might use it directly for purposes other
than file names).  Instead, first convert it to an abstract path (see
<TT> mkpath</TT> below) and then convert back to a <EM> native</EM> file name
string using one of <TT> nativeSpec</TT> or <TT> nativePreSpec</TT>.</DD>
<DT><STRONG>mkpath</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is a function of type <TT> pathmaker</TT> that produces
an abstract pathname corresponding to <TT> name</TT>.  CM will pass in different
functions here depending on whether <TT> name</TT> was given in CM's
standard pathname syntax or in the underlying operating system's
native syntax.
<PRE>

  type pathmaker = unit -&gt; presrcpath
</PRE></DD>
<DT><STRONG>class:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This argument carries the class name if such a class
name was explicitly specified.  If the class was inferred from the
member name, then it will be set to <TT> NONE</TT>.</DD>
<DT><STRONG>opts:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Tool options are represented by a data structure
resembling Lisp lists:
<PRE>

  type fnspec = { name: string, mkpath: pathmaker }
  datatype toolopt =
      STRING of fnspec
    | SUBOPTS of { name: string, opts: toolopts }
  withtype toolopts = toolopt list
</PRE>
The nesting of <TT> SUBOPTS</TT> reflects the nesting of sub-option lists
in the member's tool option specification.
Again, names which are potentially to be interpreted as file names are
represented by their original specification string and a function <TT> 
mkpath</TT> to get the corresponding abstract path, thereby taking
care of interpreting the name according to its respective syntactic
rules and its context. (Type <TT> fnspec</TT> is a slimmed-down version of
type <TT> spec</TT>.  It also appears as the argument type of function
<TT> defaultClassOf</TT>.  See below.)</DD>
<DT><STRONG>derived:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This flag is set to <TT> true</TT> if the source file
represented by the specification is the result of a another, earlier
tool invocation.</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The other three arguments of a rule function are <TT> native2pathmaker</TT>,
<TT> context</TT>, and <TT> defaultClassOf</TT>:

<P>
 
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>native2pathmaker:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This function takes a string and produces a
function of the same type as <TT> mkpath</TT> above.  When the rule
constructs the specifications for its result files, it must provide
the corresponding <TT> mkpath</TT> functions for those.  Since most tools
internally operate on native pathnames, these <TT> mkpath</TT> functions
will have to be constructed using <TT> native2pathmaker</TT>.</DD>
<DT><STRONG>context:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The context argument of a rule represents the
directory that contains the CM description file on whose behalf the
rule was invoked.  It is represented as a higher-order function that
invokes its function argument after temporarily setting the working
directory to the context directory and returns the result of this
invocation after restoring the original working directory.  Not all
rules require such a temporary change of directories, but those that
do should encapsulate all their work into a local function and then
pass this function to the context.
<PRE>

  type rulefn = unit -&gt; partial_expansion
  type rulecontext = rulefn -&gt; partial_expansion
</PRE></DD>
<DT><STRONG>defaultClassOf:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This function can be used to directly invoke
CM's internal classification mechanism, taking advantage of any
registered classifiers.  The argument to be passed is of type <TT> 
fnspec</TT>, i.e., a record consisting of a name string and a function to
convert the string to its corresponding abstract path.</DD>
</DL>

<P>
A (full) <EM> expansion</EM> consists of three lists: a list of ML files,
a list of CM files, and a list of <EM> sources</EM>.  A partial expansion
is a full expansion together with a list of specifications that still
need to be expanded further.

<P>
 
<PRE>

  type expansion =
    { smlfiles: (srcpath * Sharing.request * setup) list,
      cmfiles: (srcpath * Version.t option * rebindings) list,
      sources: (srcpath * { class: class, derived: bool}) list }

  type partial_expansion = expansion * spec list
</PRE>

<P>
A rule always returns a partial expansion.  CM will derive a full
expansion by repeatedly applying rules until the list of pending
specification becomes empty.

<P>
Most rules (except those for classes <TT> sml</TT> and <TT> cm</TT>) leave the
lists <TT> smlfiles</TT> and <TT> cmfiles</TT> empty.  A tool that produces an
ML source file or a CM description file as output should put a
specification for this file into the specification list of a partial
expansion, letting the rules for classes <TT> sml</TT> and <TT> cm</TT> take
care of the rest.  At this point we will therefore not dwell on
explanations for the types of these two fields.

<P>
The <TT> sources</TT> field is used to implement <TT> CM.sources</TT> (see
section&nbsp;<A HREF="node32.html#sec:makedepend:support">4.1.11</A>).  Therefore, the rule should
include here every file that it consumes if its implementer wishes to
have it reported by <TT> CM.sources</TT>.  (Do not include source files
that are <EM> produced</EM> by the rule because those will be reported by
subsequent rules.)
