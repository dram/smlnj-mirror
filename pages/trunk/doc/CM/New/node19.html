3.5 When to use anchor environments</A>
</H2>

<P>
The following sample scenario for using anchor environments will
provide some background on the reasons that led to the inclusion of
this feature into CM.  In short, anchor environments will typically be
used to disambiguate between two or more different uses of the same
anchor name.  This is something that the root environment alone (i.e.,
a fixed mapping from anchors to directory names) cannot do because the
root environment binds each anchor to at most one ``meaning.''

<P>
Suppose you are developing a project <TT> P.cm</TT> for which you obtain
two utility libraries <TT> A.cm</TT> and <TT> B.cm</TT> from other
programmers.  Unfortunately, since these programmers did not
coordinate their work (perhaps because they did not even know of each
other), both <TT> A.cm</TT> and <TT> B.cm</TT> each uses its own helper
library that is expected to be found under the name <TT> $H/H.cm</TT>.

<P>
Your task is to put references to <TT> A.cm</TT> and <TT> B.cm</TT> into <TT> 
P.cm</TT> so that everything ``works.''  Now, mentioning <TT> A.cm</TT> and
<TT> B.cm</TT> is easy enough, but if you do so without special
precautions, you arrive at a situation where both helpers end up being
the same--no matter how you configure the binding for anchor <TT> 
$H</TT>.

<P>
If you have access to the description files for <TT> A.cm</TT> and <TT> 
B.cm</TT>, you could work around this problem by changing the reference to
<TT> $H</TT> in one of them into something else.  Remember, however, that
in general you may not be able to do this because it could be that
either you do not have permissions to change the description files, or
you might not even have any description file that you could change
because the two libraries were given to you in ``stable'' form.

<P>
The correct solution is to add <TT> bind:</TT>-directives where you <EM> 
use</EM> <TT> A.cm</TT> and <TT> B.cm</TT> in your own description file <TT> P.cm</TT>.
For example, you could write there:

<P>
 
<PRE>

  A.cm (bind:(anchor:H value:$AH))
  B.cm (bind:(anchor:H value:$BH))
</PRE>

<P>
With this, the two uses of anchor <TT> $H</TT> will occur in different
<EM> local</EM> anchor environments.  In the example as shown, the first
such local environment effectively renames <TT> $H</TT> into <TT> $AH</TT>
while the second renames <TT> $H</TT> into <TT> $BH</TT>. Thus, you can put
independent bindings for <TT> $AH</TT> and <TT> $HB</TT> into your root
configuration, these independent bindings will propagate to the
respective local environment, and the two uses of <TT> $H</TT> will be
resolved differently--as was intended.

<P>
Another situation where anchor name clashes would definitely happen is
when two different versions (i.e., development stages) of the same set
of libraries are being used at the same time.  In this case, one
should let the libraries within each set refer to each other using
anchored names and provide (different) bindings for these names using
<TT> bind:</TT>-directives from within their respective clients.

<P>
A good way of encapsulating the construction of the required local
anchor environment for a library is to create a <EM> proxy</EM> for it
(see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node13.html#sec:proxies">2.10</A>).
