<h2>1.2. Core Language</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<h3><a name="Rebind">1.2.1. Rebinding constructor names with
<code><strong>val rec</strong></code> and <code><strong>fun</strong></code></a></h3>
In SML '90, a data constructor name can be rebound in its scope only
by another datatype declaration using that name.  In SML '97, data constructor
names can also be rebound by recursive function declarations
(<code><strong>val rec</strong></code> and
<code><strong>fun</strong></code>).
See the SML '97 Definition, page 24, rule (26).
For instance:
<pre>
  datatype t = f;
  fun f x = x;
</pre>
<blockquote>
<strong>SML/NJ Discrepancy</strong>.  This change is not yet
implemented in SML/NJ.  This is bug 1357.
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="Infix">1.2.2. Revised infix operator precedence rules</a></h3>
The way infix operators interact now conforms to the treatment SML/NJ
has always implemented (SML '97 Definition, Section 2.6, page 6).  If
<code><i>id<sub>1</sub></i></code> and
<code><i>id<sub>2</sub></i></code> are left (right) associative infix
operators of the same precedence, then an expression of the form
<pre>
  <i>aexp id<sub>1</sub> aexp id<sub>2</sub> aexp</i>
</pre>
(where <code><i>aexp</i></code> stands for atomic expressions)
associates to the left (right).  If <code><i>id<sub>1</sub></i></code>
and <code><i>id<sub>2</sub></i></code> are of the same precedence but
different associativities (i.e. one is left associative and the other
is right associative), then the SML '97 Definition says that the
expression is illegal.  SML/NJ is more lenient, and only issues a
warning in this case, and breaks the tie by associating to the left.
<pre>
  - infix 4 <<;
  infix 4 <<
  - infixr 4 >>;
  infixr 4 >>
  - fun (x>>y) = "right";
  val >> = fn : 'a * 'b -> string
  - fun (x&lt;&lt;y) = "left";
  val << = fn : 'a * 'b -> string
  - 1 << 2 >> 3;
  stdIn:21.8-21.10 Warning: mixed left- and right-associative operators of same precedence
  val it = "right" : string
  - 1 >> 2 << 3;
  stdIn:22.8-22.10 Warning: mixed left- and right-associative operators of same precedence
  val it = "left" : string
</pre>

<h3><a name="NoRebind">1.2.3. Forbidden rebindings</a></h3>
To make sure that certain derived form expansions in the semantics
(e.g. if expressions translating to case expressions) are robust, SML
'97 forbids the rebinding of <code><strong>true</strong></code>,
<code><strong>false</strong></code>,
<code><strong>nil</strong></code>, <code><strong>::</strong></code>,
and <code><strong>ref</strong></code>.  It is also forbidden to bind
<code><strong>it</strong></code> as a data constructor or exception
constructor.  These restrictions are mainly for the sake of the
semantics, since most implementations would not be broken by rebinding
these identifiers.  However, it is a good idea not to redind these
key identifers anyway, because doing so is likely to lead to confusion.
<blockquote>
<strong>SML/NJ Discrepancy</strong>: SML/NJ does not currently enforce
this restriction.  This is bug 1328.
