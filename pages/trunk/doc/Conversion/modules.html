<h2>1.3. Modules</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<p>
Significant changes were made in the SML module system in SML '97.
The motivations for this change were to simplify the semantics of the
module system, mainly by weakening the notion of structure sharing,
and to improve the expressiveness of signatures by adding definitional 
type specifications.

The addition of definitional type specifications is accompanied with
new restrictions on type sharing specs.  In many cases where type
sharing specs would have been used in SML '90, in SML '97 it is
necessary, or perhaps just better style, to use definitional type
specifications.

In SML '97, structures do not have unique, checkable static
identities, and structure sharing is viewed as an abbreviation
for implied type sharing.  The lack of a structure level equivalent of 
definitional type specs was soon found to be awkward, and SML/NJ has
implemented this useful feature (<a href="module-extensions.html#StrDefSpecs">
Section 1.6.2</a>).

<h3><a name="SigDefs">
1.3.1. Type abbreviations in signatures</a></h3>
<p>
SML '97 Definition, Section G.1.
<p>
It has long been realized that the original signature language of SML
'90 was not expressive enough for some purposes.  In particular, it
was not possible in general to indicate both the existence and the
definition of a type component in a specification.  In special cases,
one could use a <em>definitional</em> type sharing specification, as in
<pre>
    signature S =
    sig
      type t sharing type t = int
    end
</pre>
but this would not work if <code>t</code>'s definition was a type 
expression like <code>int list</code>.  So in SML '97 the
definition of type specification is extended to allow
specifications of the form:
<pre>
    <b>type</b> <i>tyvarseq tycon</i> = <i>ty</i>
</pre>
We call such a specification a <em>definitional spec</em> (also
sometimes referred to as <em>type abbreviation spec</em>).  Using this
sort of specification, we can rewrite the above signature more neatly
as follows:
<pre>
    signature S =
    sig
      type t = int list
    end
</pre>
Allowing type definition specs in signatures makes it possible to
write a signature that more fully captures or constrains the type
information in a structure.  It also makes it more practical to use
the opaque form of signature matching described below
(Section <a href="#Opaque">1.3.9</a>),
because one has more control over which exported types are abstract
(<em>opaque</em>) and which are concrete (<em>transparent</em>).
<p>
Type definition specs were introduced in SML/NJ starting with version
0.93, and they have also been supported in Caml Special Light and
Ocaml(?).  The main improvement made in SML '97 is to reduce
confusing interactions between type definition specs and type sharing
specs by placing new restrictions on type sharing specs.  We restrict
the types that can appear in a sharing spec to those specified within
the current signature (Section <a href="#LocalSharing">1.3.4</a>),
and we ban definitional sharing specs (Section <a
href="#SharingVsDefn">1.3.5</a>).  We also increase the usefulness of
definitional specs by using the "<code>where type</code>" syntax to
attach definitions to previously defined signatures (Section <a
href="#WhereType">1.3.3</a>).  The resulting design gives us more
expressive power than SML '90.
<p>
The motivations for introducing type definition specs also apply to
structure specs.  In SML '90 programs we often use definitional
<em>structure</em> sharing specs, bug this form of sharing spec is
not allowed is SML '97.  Clearly a structure analogue of type definition
specs would be a convenient replacement, but unfortunately SML '97 does not
provide them.  So SML/NJ fills this gap, as described below in the
section on structure definition specs
(<a href="module-extensions.html#StrDefSpecs">Section 1.6.2</a>).

<h3><a name="ReplSpecs">
1.3.2. Datatype replication specs</a></h3>
<p>
Datatype replication declarations were described in 
<a href="types.html#Replication">Section 1.1.5</a>.  An
analogous datatype replication specification form has been provided
for signatures, and it has the same syntax as the declarations:
<pre>
    <strong>datatype</strong> <i>tycon</i> = <strong>datatype</strong> <i>longtycon</i>
</pre>
Datatype replication specs serve the same purpose for datatype specs
as definitional type specs do for simple type specs, and we use the 
term <em>definitional specifications</em> to cover these two forms.
Here is an example
<pre>
    structure A =
    struct
      datatype 'a t = C | D of 'a * 'a t
    end

    signature S =
    sig
      datatype t = datatype A.t
    end
</pre>
Note that even though <code>A.t</code> (and hence <code>t</code>) is 
a unary type constructor, we do not include formal type variable
parameters in the datatype replication spec.  The effect of this spec
is to define type component <code>t</code> to be the same as
<code>A.t</code>, and in addition it implicitly specifies the
data constructors <code>C</code> and <code>D</code> associated with
<code>A.t</code>.  Thus in a functor declaration such as
<pre>
    functor F(X: S) : sig val f : 'a X.t -> 'a A.t end =
    struct
      fun f(X.C) = X.C
	| f(X.D(x,y)) = A.D(x,X.D(x,y))
    end
</pre>
it is guaranteed that <code>X.t</code> and <code>A.t</code> are
the same type and <code>A.D</code> and <code>X.D</code> are the same
data constructor.
<p>
As explained below in <a href="#NoDefShare">Section 1.3.6</a>,
one of the main uses of datatype replication specs
is to substitute for definitional sharing constraints, which are
no longer allowed.

<h3><a name="WhereType">
1.3.3. Modifying signatures with <code>where type</code></a></h3>
<p>
Sometimes it's "too late" to use a definitional type spec when we need
one.  By this I am refering to cases where the type we would like to
define is specified in a signature that has already been declared,
perhaps in a library.  For example, suppose <code>S1</code> is a large
signature with a simple specification of type <code>t</code>:
<pre>
    signature S1 =
    sig
      type t
      ... (* twenty other specifications *)
    end
</pre>
Later we want to use <code>S1</code>, but we want to specify in
addition that <code>t</code> is <code>int list</code>).  
<p>
One could insert 
<code>S1</code>'s defining signature expression in place of
<code>S1</code>, modified with the appropriate definition of
<code>t</code>, but this is obviously undesirable when <code>S1</code>
is a large signature.
SML '97 provides another solution to this problem in the form of the
<code><strong>where type</strong></code> definition.  It modifies
an existing signature by adding a definition of one of it's types.
In our example, we would use it as follows:
<pre>
    signature S2 =
    sig
      structure A : S1 where type t = int list
    end
</pre>
Here the <code>where type</code> definition modifies or augments the
signature <code>S1</code>, and <code>S1 where type A.t = int</code>
is a new form of signature expression.  With <code>where type</code>
we are able to express things that we couldn't express before with
definitional sharing constraints, like
<pre>
    signature S2 =
    sig
      structure A : S1 where type t = int list
    end
</pre>
We can even use <code>where type</code> clauses in cases where the
type to be defined is buried inside a substructure, as in the
following example
<pre>
    signature U =
    sig
      structure A : S1
      ...
    end

    signature S2 =
    sig
      structure B : U where type A.t = int list
    end
</pre>
Note that here the left hand side of the <code>where type</code> clause
is a symbolic path <code>A.t</code> (a <i>longtycon</i> in the
Definition's terminology), and the effect is to augment the
specification of <code>t</code> in <code>S1</code>.
<p>
<strong>Datatypes defined by where clauses.</strong>
The type defined by a <code>where type</code> clause can be one
that was specified as a datatype.
<pre>
    structure A =
    struct
      datatype 'a t = C | D of 'a * 'a t
    end

    signature S =
    sig
      datatype 'a t = C | D of 'a * 'a t
    end

    signature U = S where type 'a t = 'a A.t
</pre>
In this example, the <code>where type</code> is equivalent to an embedded 
datatype replication spec, so signature <code>U</code> could
equivalently have been defined as
<pre>
    signature U =
    sig
      datatype t = datatype A.t
    end
</pre>
Technically, the Definition is rather lenient about consistency between
the affected primary specification and its definition in a where
clause.  For instance, the following signature declaration is legal,
<pre>
    signature S =
    sig
      datatype t = T
    end
    where type t = int
</pre>
though such a signature cannot be realized because the 
base specification of <code>t</code> and its definition in
the where clause are not consistent.  A compiler might
check for such obvious inconsistencies (but SML/NJ does not).
<p>
<strong>Context of right hand side of where definition.</strong>
The type expression on the right hand side of a <code>where
type</code> definition cannot mention types that are specified
in the signature it modifies.  So the following example is
illegal (assuming no type <code>t</code> is defined in the 
context of this declaration).
<pre>
    signature S =
    sig
      type s
      type t
    end
    where type s = t
</pre>
The reason for this restriction is that we want to avoid examples
like the following
<pre>
    signature S =
    sig
      type s
      structure A :
	sig
	  type t
	  val x : s * t
	end
    end

    signature U = S where type s = A.t * A.t
</pre>
If the <code>A.t</code> on the right hand side of the <code>where
type</code> clause refers to the type specified inside the signature
<code>S</code>, then we will have created a kind of undesirable circular
dependency, where type <code>s</code> depends on the substructure
<code>A</code> because of the where definition, while <code>A</code>
depends on <code>s</code> because <code>s</code> is mentioned in
<code>A</code>'s signature.
<p>
We would like to be able to replace any signature definition using
the <code>where type</code> construct by an equivalent definition
that replaces the where definitions with
type abbreviation specs and datatype replication specs.  It is clear
that the signature <code>U</code> in the last example could not be
expressed without the <code>where type</code> clause under this interpretation
of the context of the clause's right hand side.  This is why we
exclude the body of the modified signature from the context of the
right hand side and thereby make this example illegal.
<p>
<blockquote>
<strong>SML/NJ Discrepancy</strong>: The natural way of thinking of
the <code>where type</code> construct is that is is a way of
introducing type abbreviation specs (or datatype replication specs)
into a previously defined signature, thereby producing an augmented
version of that signature.  It should in principle be possible to
equivalently define that augmented signature with the definitions placed
directly at the points of specification of the affected types.  This
is in fact how SML/NJ implements <code>where type</code> definitions.
Thus
<pre>
    signature S =
    sig
      type t
    end
    where type t = int
</pre>
is tranformed by the compiler into the declaration
<pre>
    signature S =
    sig
      type t = int
    end
</pre>
Thus treating type abbreviation specs as the primary construct and
defining <code>where type</code> in terms of it.
<p>
However, for technical reasons the Definition does things backward,
treating <code>where type</code> as a primary notion and
defining type abbreviation specs (but not datatype replication
specs) in terms of <code>where type</code> and <code>include</code>.
Thus in the Definition,
<pre>
    signature S =
    sig
      type t = int
    end
</pre>
is translated into
<pre>
    signature S =
    sig
      include sig type t end where type t = int
    end
</pre>
For the most part, this difference in approaches does not matter.
The Definition's version admits more signatures as legal, but we
argue that they are not signatures that good programmers would
want to write.  Here is an example of a legal signature that is
not accepted by SML/NJ (due to Marin Elsman, see SML/NJ bug 1330):
<pre>
    signature S =
    sig
      type s
      structure U : sig
	type 'a t
	type u = (int * real) t
      end where type 'a t = s
    end where type U.u = int
</pre>
We leave it as an exercise for diligent language lawyers to verify
that this is acceptible under the definition, but it is pretty clearly
not the sort of thing we want to encourage programmers to write.
Determining whether this signature makes sense is an exercise in
setting up a system of equations in higher-order variables
(<code>s</code>, <code>u</code>, and <code>t</code>) and then
seeking a solution of that system.  We would prefer that the
sensibility of a signature definition should be more obvious.
<p>
One particular reason why this signature declaration is not accepted
by SML/NJ is that SML/NJ does not allow a <code>where type</code>
definition to apply to a type constructor that already has a
definitional specification.  A simpler example of a signature
that is rejected for this reason is:
<pre>
    signature S =
    sig
      type s
      type t = s
    end
    where type t = int
</pre>
A more sensible way to write this would be
<pre>
    signature S =
    sig
      type s
      type t = s
    end
    where type s = int
</pre>
which <em>is</em> acceptible to SML/NJ.
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="LocalSharing">
1.3.4. Restriction of sharing to local paths</a></h3>
<p>
<!-- this belongs in 1.3.4
The type paths in a
type sharing specification must be local to the previous specifications
in the signature, which means that the declaration of signature
<code>S</code> above is no longer legal.  Instead, we
<em>must</em> employ a type definition spec and write
<pre>
  signature S =
  sig
    type t = int
  end
</pre>
(or the equivalent version using <code><strong>where
type</strong></code> (see next topic).  This form is clearer
and more concise in any case.
<p>
A type sharing spec as in the first declaration of <code>S</code>
is called a definitional sharing constraint, since it identifies
a formal, unknown type <code>t</code> with the known type <code>int</code>,
thereby effectively defining t.  The SML '97 design eliminates 
definitional sharing constraints, with the intension that they
should be replaced by more direct type definition specs.
-->
In SML '90, a sharing specification is an independent specification
in a signature, but in SML '97, sharing specifications modify the
specifications (a sequencial spec) that they follow textually in
the signature.  The components mentioned in the sharing constraint must
all come from the specifications modified by the sharing constraint.
Thus, in
<pre>
    [1]  signature S =
    [2]  sig
    [3]    type s
    [4]    structure A : sig
    [5]		           type t
    [6]		           type u
    [7]		           sharing type t = u
    [8]		           sharing type t = s
    [9]		         end
    [10] end
</pre>
the sharing constraint in line [7] applies to the preceding specs in
lines [5] and [6], and is legal because the type names <code>t</code>
and <code>u</code> mentioned in the sharing constraint are bound in
those specs.  The sharing constraint at line [8], on the other hand,
is not legal, because its "scope" consists of lines [5-7], while it
mentions the type <code>s</code> bound lin line [3].  The same rule
applies to structure sharing constraints.
<p>
This scope restriction on sharing constraints is the main reason
why sharing constraints may need to be converted into definitional
specs or <code>where</code> definitions.  The declaration of
<code>S</code> above can be rewritten as the following legal SML '97
declaration.
<pre>
    [1] signature S =
    [2] sig
    [3]   type s
    [4]   structure A : sig
    [5]		        type t = s
    [6]		        type u = t
    [7]		      end
    [8] end
</pre>
It can also be legally rewritten (according to the Definition) as
<pre>
    [1] signature S =
    [2] sig
    [3]   type s
    [4]   structure A : sig
    [5]		        type t = s
    [6]		        type u
    [7]		        sharing type t = u
    [8]		      end
    [9] end
</pre>
but this version raises a delicate and controversial point.  Notice
that the type <code>t</code> is defined in its specification at
line [5], and it is further constrained by the sharing constraint at
line [7].  

<h3><a name="SharingVsDefn">
1.3.5. Noninterference of sharing and definitional specs</a></h3>
<p>
In SML '90, there were two flavors of type sharing, one where both
types involved are "formal" or unknown, which we call <em>coherence
sharing</em>, and the other sort, where one type is unknown and the other
is known, which we call <em>definitional sharing</em>.  Here is a typical
example of coherence sharing:
<pre>
    signature S =
    sig
      type t
      type s
      sharing type t = s
    end
</pre>
In this case, neither <code>t</code> nor <code>s</code> is determined,
but the sharing spec requires that when they are instantiated, they
are both instantiated to the same type.
<p>
A simple example of definitional sharing is:
<pre>
    signature S =
    sig
      type t
      sharing type t = int
    end
</pre>
where type <code>t</code> is effectively defined to be equal to
<code>int</code> by the sharing constraint.
<p>
In SML '97, it is possible to define a type directly, in its
original specification, or after the fact, using the "where type" syntax, so
definitional sharing seems redundant.  Furthermore, the interaction
between definitional sharing and direct definition could create
puzzles, such as the following:
<pre>
    signature S =
    sig
      type s
      type t = s list
      type 'a u
      type v = int u
      sharing type t = v
    end
</pre>
Here, types <code>t</code> and <code>v</code> are defined directly in
terms of the formal types <code>s</code> and <code>u</code>, and then
they are equated by the sharing specification.  If we wanted to
determine whether this signature is satisfiable, we would have to see
whether types s and u exist that satisfy the equation
<pre>
    s list = int u
</pre>
Solving such second-order equations is a messy problem in general,
perhaps unsolvable.  To solve this problem, the SML '97 design
excludes such examples by outlawing definitional sharing.  In other
words, the types involved in a sharing specification are required to
be formal or "flexible".
<p>
Technically, the Definition requires that a type constructor involved
in a sharing constraint be (1) not defined as a type function, and (2)
not defined in terms of some "rigid" type constructor (i.e. a type
constructor previously defined in the context).
<p>
We choose to define "sharable" as meaning simply that there is <em>
no</em> definition applying to a type constructor.  We'll use the term
"defined" for the opposite of sharable.  A more subtle definition is
possible; see note <a href="#SharableTypes">"Sharable Types"</a> below.
<p>
Thus the following signature is illegal
<pre>
    signature S =
    sig
      type s = int  (* s is defined *)
      type t        (* t is sharable *)
      sharing type t = s  (* s is not sharable *)
    end
</pre>
and has to be reexpressed as (for instance):
<pre>
    signature S =
    sig
      type s = int
      type t = s
    end
</pre>
With "where type" definitions, things are a little more complicated.  An
inner type sharing constraint can be affected by an outer definitional
constraint, as in the following example:
<pre>
    signature S1 =
    sig
      type s
      type t
      sharing type t = s  (* ok, because s and t are sharable here *)
    end
    where type t = int;  (* this converts both s and t to rigid types *)
</pre>
This is legal, but the following declaration is not:
<pre>
    signature S2 =
    sig 
      structure A : S1
      type v
      sharing type v = A.s  (* A.s not flexible *)
    end;
</pre>
However, S2 can easily be converted to the legal S3 below by
replacing the outer sharing constraint by a definition.
<pre>
    signature S3 =
    sig 
      structure A : S1
      type v = A.s
    end;
</pre>
In general, we recommend avoiding sharing constraints that can easily
be expressed by definitional specs.  So one should always prefer
<pre>
    type t = s
</pre>
to 
<pre>
    type t
    sharing type t = s.
</pre>
The same applies to structure sharing and structure definition specs
(which are an SML/NJ language extension).  Violations of this newly
enforced constraint can often be eliminated by replacing structure
sharing by structure definition specs, e.g. replacing
<pre>
    structure A : SIGA
    sharing A = B.C
</pre>
with
<pre>
    structure A : SIGA = B.C.
</pre>

<h4><a name="StructSharingException">
1.3.5.1 SML/NJ Exception for Structure Sharing with Same Signature</a></h4>
<p>
SML/NJ provides one important exception to the rule about sharing rigid
types.  This is the case where the type sharing is implied by structure
sharing between two structures with the same signature.
<p>
Here is an example
<pre>
    signature S =
    sig
      type t = int
    end

    signature S1 =
    sig
      structure A : S
      structure B : S
      sharing A = B
    end
</pre>
This is allowed in SML/NJ because A and B have the same signature, even
though the sharing constraint is equivalent to
<pre>
    sharing type A.t = B.t
</pre>
and A.t and B.t have the rigid spec
<pre>
    type t = int.
</pre>

<h4><a name="SharableTypes">
1.3.5.2 What Types Are Sharable [Mostly for language lawyers]</a></h4>
<p>
There is some controversy about what type constructors should be
allowed in sharing constraints.  We can illustrate this by the
following example
<pre>
    signature S =
    sig
      type s
      type t = s
      type u
      sharing type t = u
    end
</pre>
By our definition above, <code>t</code> is defined, and therefore not sharable, and
this signature declaration is rejected.  Technically, however, the
semantic representation of <code>t</code> in the signature is the type function
<code>\().(()<i>ns</i>)</code> (a nullary type function, where
<code><i>ns</i></code> is the semantic type
"name" for <code>s</code>), and this type function is eta-equivalent
to <code><i>ns</i></code>, a simple flexible type name.  Therefore,
if this eta-reduction is
assumed, <code>t</code> meets the requirements of the definition and can appear in
the sharing constraint.  On the other hand, consider
<pre>
    signature S =
    sig
      type s
      type t = s list
      type u
      sharing type t = u
    end
</pre>
Here the representation of <code>t</code> is the type function
<code>\().(()ns) list</code>,
which does not reduce to a simple type name, so the sharing constraint
is clearly illegal.

The reasons that we adopt the simpler and more restrictive meaning of
sharable are that it is easier to explain and it admits all sensible
usages.  We claim that it promotes a cleaner and simpler style in
signature writing.  It is also much simpler more efficient to
implement (at least for SML/NJ).

Here are some example signatures that are admitted under the
more complicated version of the definition (thanks to Martin Elsman of 
DIKU):
<pre>
    signature S1 =
    sig
      type t
      type s = t
    end where type s = int

    signature S2 =
    sig
      type t
      type s = t
      sharing type t = s
    end

    signature S3 =
    sig
      type s
      structure U :
	sig
	  type 'a t
	  type u = (int * real) t
	end where type 'a t = s
    end where type U.u = int
</pre>
It is not clear that examples like these have any importance to anyone
other than language lawyers.  The last is particularly perverse: reading
a signature should not be an exercise in puzzle solving!


<h3><a name="NoDefShare">
1.3.6. Replacement of "definitional" sharing by definitional specs</a></h3>
<p>
We used to be able to use a definitional sharing
specification, as illustrated by:
<pre>
    signature S2 =
    sig
      structure A : S1
      sharing type A.t = int
    end
</pre>
But this sharing is no loner legal, because <code>int</code> is not
a path local to the body of <code>S2</code>.  
<!-- 
more introductory text on sharing ==> definitions
-->
There are situations where you have a choice of using sharing
specifications or type definition specs or <code>where type</code>
clauses.  For instance, the following three declarations of signature
<code>S</code> are equivalent:
<pre>
    signature T = sig type s end

    signature S =
    sig
      type t
      structure A : T
      sharing type t = A.s
    end

    signature S =
    sig
      type t
      structure A : sig type s = t end  (* expanding T *)
    end

    signature S =
    sig
      type t
      structure A : T where type s = t
    end
</pre>
This last example might suggest that one could always replace
type sharing specs with type definition specs or <code>where
type</code> clauses, but this is not quite the case, as shown
by the following example:
<pre>
    signature S =
    sig
      type s
      structure A : sig
		      datatype d = D of s
		      datatype t = K
		    end
      sharing type s = A.t
    end
</pre>
There is no way to rearrange the definition of the signature
<code>S</code> so that the sharing spec can be replaced by a
definition.  However, this example is rather contrived, and it
is not clear that there would be any serious practical impact
if we gave up the ability to write such signatures and uniformly
used definitional specs in place of sharing.
<p>
The <code>where type</code> construct can also be used to define
types specified as datatypes in the base signature, and this makes
it related to the datatype replication specs described below.
Here is an example.
<pre>
    structure A =
    struct
      datatype t = T
    end

    signature S =
    sig
      datatype t = T
    end

    signature S1 = S where type t = A.t
</pre>
This capability to <em>define</em> a datatype spec is needed in
order to replace definitional sharing constraints like in the
following example:
<pre>
    signature S =
    sig
      datatype t = T
      sharing type t = A.t
    end
</pre>  
The definition in this case does not require a check that the
datatype "signature" of the spec and its definition in the
<code>where type</code> clause have to agree, but a compiler
could perform some level of checking.  It might at least check
that the type on the right hand side of the definition is also
a datatype, and beyond that it might check that the number and
names of data constructors agree.

<h3><a name="StrSharing">
1.3.7. Structure sharing as derived form for type sharing</a></h3>
<p>
In SML '97, structure sharing has been weakened from a first-class
feature to a derived syntax feature, i.e. a feature that is explained
in terms of translation to type sharing syntax.  This is a real
weakening of the expressiveness of the module system.  In SML '90,
where each structure had a unique static identity and structure
sharing could be checked statically, one could use structure sharing
to guarantee not only that types in two structures agreed, but that
the values making up the associated interface to those types were also
shared.  For instance, if two structures <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> have the signature
<code>ORD</code> defined below
<pre>
    signature ORD =
    sig
      type t
      val comp : t * t -> t
    end
</pre>
the sharing specification
<pre>
    sharing A = B
</pre>
guarantees not only that the types <code>A.t</code> and
<code>B.t</code> are the same but that the comparison operations
<code>A.comp</code> and <code>B.comp</code> were the same, i.e. that
<code>A</code> and <code>B</code> implement the same ordering over the
same type.
<p>
In SML '97, we can still write such sharing specification, but they
are viewed as abbreviations for all possible implied type sharing
specs.  In this case, the above structure sharing spec translates to
the following type sharing spec:
<pre>
    sharing type A.t = B.t
</pre>
This does not imply that the comparison operators A.comp and B.comp
agree, so it is strictly weaker than the structure sharing spec in SML 
'90.
<p>
One can recover something like the old structure sharing functionality
when the structures in question contain a (generative) type that is
used to uniquely identify the structure.  In effect, the type is used
as a unique tag to guarantee identity of the structure as a whole.
This works if there is no "cheating", i.e. if no other independently
defined structure incorporates this same tagging type.
<p>
Another thing to note about the weak version of structure sharing
is that it is not transitive.  For instance
<pre>
    sharing A = B and B = C
</pre>
does not necessarily imply that 
<pre>
    sharing A = C
</pre>
is satisfied.  Here is an example
<pre>
    signature S0 =
    sig
      type t
    end

    signature S =
    sig
      structure A : S0
      structure B : sig end
      structure C : S0
      sharing A = B and B = C
    end
</pre>
Since structure <code>B</code> has no type components, the sharing
equations <code>A = B</code> and <code>B = C</code> are vacuous, and
translate into no type sharing at all.  In particular, they do not guarantee
that <code>A.t = C.t</code>, and therefore do not imply the sharing
constraint <code>A = C</code>.
<p>
The paths appearing is structure sharing specs must also satisfy the
locality restriction described in <a href="#LocalSharing">Section
1.3.4</a>.  That is, the structures that are specified to share must
all be components (or subcomponents) of the same signature that
contains the sharing spec.  This will guarantee that the type sharing
specs that the structure sharing translates into will satisfy the
locality constraint for type sharing.
<p>
This locality rule will generally preclude "definitional structure
sharing specs", which are used fairly frequently in SML '90.  How
should we rewrite such definitional structure sharing specs?  One
approach is to expand the structure sharing into the corresponding set 
of type sharing specs, and then replace the definitional type sharing
specs with the appropriate "where type" definitions.  For example, 
given a structure A defined as follows:
<pre>
structure A =
struct
  datatype t = T
end
</pre>
the SML '90 signature
<pre>
signature S =
sig
  structure B : sig type t end
  sharing B = A
end
</pre>
can be rewritten as
<pre>
signature S =
sig
  structure B : sig type t end where type t = A.t
end
</pre>
Of course, if there were a dozen types involved in A rather than just
one, this can lead to an unpleasant expansion of the code.  For this
reason, it would have been desirable to have a structure analogue of
definitional specs, so that we could write something like:
<pre>
signature S =
sig
  structure B : sig type t end = A
end
</pre>
Such definitional structure specs are in fact supported in SML/NJ;
see <a href="module-extensions.html#StrDefSpec">Section 1.6.2</a>.

<h3><a name="IncludeSigExp">
1.3.8. <code>include <i>sigexp</i></code></a></h3>
<p>
The syntax of the <code>include</code> spec has been generalized
to allow arbitrary signature expressions as well as signature names.
The purpose of this extension is to allow definitional type specs
to be defined in terms of <code>include</code> and <code>where
type</a> as a derived form.  Thus 
<pre>
    type t = <i>ty</i>
</pre>
is supposed to be an abbreviation for
<pre>
    include sig type t end where type t = <i>ty</i>
</pre>
This seems somewhat convoluted, since the simple type definition spec
seems to be a more elementary concept in its own right, but this
approach was chosen because of technical convenience in the
Definition.  There is a technical problem with treating simple
definitional specs as the primitive construct and defining <code>where
type</code> via a syntactic translation into definitional specs, and
that is the issue of free variable capture.  For instance, in the
following signature definition the type <code>u</code> appearing 
in the <code>where type</code> clause is different from the type
<code>u</code> specified in the body of <code>S</code>.
<pre>
signature S =
sig
  type u
  type t
end
where type t = u * u
</pre>
If we were to eliminate the <code>where type</code> clause in the
following definition by textually moving the definition inward to the point where
<code>t</code> is specified, we would have
signature S =
sig
  type u
  type t = u * u
end
</pre>
which is clearly incorrect, because the free occurences of <code>u</code>
in the definition of <code>t</code> have been captured by the local
binding of <code>u</code>.  So though this approach to eliminating
<code>where type</code> can work at the level of semantic structures,
it doesn't work as a textual transformation (i.e. as a derived form).

<h3><a name="Opaque">
1.3.9. opaque signature matching <code>:&gt;</code></a></h3>
<p>
Previous versions of SML/NJ supported a special structure declaration
form
<pre>
    abstraction S : SIG = struct ... end
</pre>
whose purpose was to create an "abstract" instance of the signature
<code>SIG</code>.  This feature was left out of SML '90 for various
reasons, but the need for it was real.
<p>
In SML '97, a similar feature has been provided in the form of
"opaque" signature matching using the special signature constraint
syntax <code>S :> SIG</code>.  For example, the following declaration
has the same effect as the old "abstraction" declaration given above.
<pre>
    structure S :> SIG = struct ... end
</pre>
The effect of opaque signature matching is that the formal or flexible
types in the signature SIG get fresh, abstract instantiations that are
distinct from the corresponding types in the structure expression
being constrained.  Here is a more detailed example:
<pre>
signature SIG =
sig
  type s
  type t = int
  val zero : s
  val succ : s -> s
  val f : s -> t
end

strucutre Transp : SIG =
struct
  type s = int
  type t = int
  val zero = 0
  fun succ x = x+1
  fun f x = x
end

strucutre Opaque :> SIG =
struct
  type s = int
  type t = int
  val zero = 0
  fun succ x = x+1
  fun f x = x
end
</pre>
Because of the normal transparent signature matching, Transp.s is
equivalent to <code>int</code>, as is Transp.t.  But in the case of
<code>Opaque</code>, <code>Opaque.t</code> is still equivalent to
<code>int</code>, because of the definition in the signature, but
<code>Opaque.s</code> is a new abstract type that is different from
<code>int</code>.
<p>
There are two places where it may make sense to use opaque signature
matching.  First in a normal structure declaration as in the above
examples, and second in specifying the result signature of a functor.
<pre>
functor F(X: PSIG) :> SIG = struct ... end
</pre>
When a functor is defined with an opaque result signature like this,
each time the functor is applied a new abstract instantiation of the
result signature is created.
<p>
It does not make sense to use the opaque signature matching form
for the formal parameter of a functor (i.e. on the input side as
opposed to the output side).
<p>

<h3><a name="Equality">
1.3.10. equality type specs, inferred equality properties</a></h3>
<p>

<h3><a name="Obsolete">
1.3.11. <tt>open</tt> and <tt>local</tt> specification forms deleted</a></h3>
<p>
The Definition of SML '90 had two special forms of specification that
could be used in signatures: <code>local...in..end</code> and
<code>open</close>.  These forms, particularly local specs, were
introduced for technical reasons within the definition.

These specification forms have both been dropped in SML '97.  These
features were controversial in SML '90, because when used in full
generality their behavior had no clear intuitive justification,
despite their having a precise technical meaning and a technical role
in the Definition's semantics.

The utility of these features was also dubious, except for one special
restricted case, where open and local were combinded to allow the
abbreviation of type paths in specifications.  For example:
<pre>
    structure A =
    struct
      type t = int
    end;

    signature S =
    sig
      local open A in
	val x : t
      end
    end;
</pre>
Here the <code>open A</code> specification allows
<code>A.t</code> to be abbreviated to <code>t</code>, while the
<code>local</code> form prevents the components of <code>A</code>
from being added to <code>S</code> as specifications.
So this definition of signature <code>S</code> is equivalent to
writing
<pre>
    signature S =
    sig
      val x : A.t
    end;
</pre>
<p>
In SML/NJ, local and open were never fully implemented according
to the SML '90 Definition, but they were partially implemented to
support just the above path abbreviation idiom.  In fact, the open
form was implemented so that it could be used for abbreviational
effect even without the surrounding local spec.  Thus in SML/NJ 0.93
it was possible to write simply
<pre>
    signature S =
    sig
      open A
      val x : t
    end;
</pre>
with the same effect.
<p>
Since these forms have been dropped in SML '97, when converting 
SML '90 (or SML/NJ 0.93) code it is necessary to find and eliminate uses
of local and open in signatures and write out the full type paths
for those types which were thereby abbreviated.
<p>
Any (non SML/NJ) code that uses local specs in their full generality
to achieve some strange effect will have to be rewritten to achieve
the desired effect some other way
[<a href="mailto:dbm@research.bell-labs.com">dbm</a>: I would be
interested in seeing examples of this].
