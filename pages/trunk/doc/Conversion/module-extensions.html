<p>
Structure definition specs can easily give rise to redefinitions.  Consider 
the following example:
<pre>
  signature S1 =
  sig
    type t
  end;

  signature S2 =
  sig
    structure A : S1
    structure B : S1 = A
  end;

  signature S3 =
  sig
    structure C : S2
    structure D : S2 = C
  end;
</pre>
Here the substructure <code>D.B</code> of <code>S3</code> is defined
within <code>S2</code> in terms of <code>D.A</code>
(implying <code>D.B.t = D.A.t</code>), while by the definitional spec
in <code>S3</code>, <code>D.B</code> is
equal to <code>C.B</code> (implying <code>D.B.t = C.B.t</code>).
<p>
There are two ways of dealing with such secondary, or layered
definitional specs.
<ol>
  <li> Secondary definitions can be treated as errors (excepting
      those cases where the equivalence of the definitions can easily be
      verified).  This was the policy for 110.0.3 through 110.8, where
      examples like the above gave rise to the error message
      <pre>
        Error: possibly inconsistent structure definitions
      </pre>
      [This was bug 1354.]

  <li> The redefinitions can be regarded as producing implied sharing
      constraints (e.g. <code>D.A.t = C.B.t</code> in this case).
</ol>
In case (2), these implied sharing constraints will be verified
automatically during signature matching, in the process of matching
all the definitional specifications.  The question is whether they
should be taken into account (i.e. satisfied) when instantiating a
signature like <code>S3</code>.  We adopt the lenient policy of not dealing with
these implied constraints during instantiation.  Instead, during
instantiation secondary definitions are simply ignored.  In the
example, the inner definition <code>D.B.t = D.A.t</code> takes effect while the
secondary definition <code>D.B.t = C.B.t</code> is ignored.
<p>
The consequence of this policy is that some additional inconsistent
signatures will be successfully instantiated.  As usual, any attempt
to match these inconsistent signatures will fail.
<p>
The compiler flag
<pre>
  Compiler.Control.multDefWarn : bool ref
</pre>
controls whether a warning message will be generated when a secondary
definition is ignored.  It's default value is false, meaning no warning
messages will be produced.
<p>
We follow a stricter policy in some other cases, such as layered type
definition specs:
<pre>
  signature S = sig
    type t
    type s = t
  end where type s = int
</pre>
Here the secondary redefinition "where type s = int" is detected and
causes an error message.
<pre>
  Error: where type defn applied to definitional spec: s
</pre>
NOTE: This is an SML/NJ divergence, since the above signature is legal
in SML '97.  See Note "Sharable Types" below.
