<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The SML/NJ Library</H1>
<P>
<blockquote>
The SML/NJ Library consists of the following components
<UL>
<LI> Util - general data structures like sets and maps
<LI> Unix - system interfaces special to Unix
<LI> INet - programming with sockets
<LI> PP - pretty printing
<LI> RegExp - regular expression pattern matching
<LI> HTML - HTML parsing and processing
<LI> Reactive - Sugarcube-like reactive programming
</UL>
The documentation for the SML/NJ Library is incomplete.  However, much
of the Util component and the RegExp component of the library are
covered in the <A HREF="Manual/toc.html"><strong>SML/NJ Library
Manual</strong></A>.  For documentation of Util modules not covered
here, see the comments in the source files for the various signature
modules (e.g. src/smlnj-lib/Util/hash-table-sig.sml).
<p>
For other components, the corresponding source directories
(e.g. src/smlnj-lib/Unix) contain README files, and further
documentation can be gleaned from the source files, particularly the
signature files.
<p>
To assist in converting code from earlier versions of SML/NJ, there is a brief 
<A HREF="PORTING">Porting Guide</A>
that lists name changes, deletions, and additions in the library
relative to the 0.3beta release from 1994.  This Porting Guide is
also found in the smlnj-lib source directory in the file named PORTING.
<p>
<blockquote>
<strong>NOTE:</strong>.  In order to compile a program that uses
	the SML/NJ Library under CM, you need to include "smlnj-lib.cm" in the
	program's CM description file.  This will work assuming the
	CM path is set up properly to find the standard libraries; if
	not, you may have to set the path manually (<code>CM.set_path</code>) or
	via the CM_PATH environment variable.
