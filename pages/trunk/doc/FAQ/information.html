<H2>SML Information Sources</H2>

<P>
The <A HREF="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj/index.html">SML/NJ web
pages</A> contain pointers to the current software distribution for
the official public release (version 0.93), and the latest
developmental, or "working", versions.  There is also a brief
description of the revised SML '97 language definition, and pointers to
the documentation for the new <A HREF="http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/%7Ejhr/sml/basis/index.html">SML Basis
library</A>.  The 
<A HREF="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj/doc/CM/index.html">CM Manual</A>,
describes CM, the compilation manager for SML/NJ developed by Matthias Blume.
The manuals for CM, ml-yacc, ml-lex, and ml-burg can
currently be found in the corresponding src directories in the SML/NJ
software distribution (e.g. src/cm/Doc/manual.ps,
src/ml-yacc/doc/mlyacc.tex).
</P>
<P>
There is a page comparing the
<A HREF="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj/doc/Conversion/top-level-comparison.html">
top level environments</A> of SML/NJ 0.93 with current working versions
of SML/NJ that comply with the SML '97 basis.  This guide is useful for
those converting programs to the new basis, or for those learning SML
from textbooks that assume the 0.93 environment.
</P>
<P>
The <A HREF="news:comp.lang.ml">comp.lang.ml</A> newsgroup carries articles discussing ML in
general, including Standard ML and other dialects like Caml and Ocaml. The
<A HREF="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/meta-lang-faq/faq.html">comp.lang.ml FAQ</A>
provides general information about various ML systems and resources.
