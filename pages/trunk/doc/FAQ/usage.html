      <h1>Using the SML/NJ System</h1>
<P>
This page covers some basic questions on how to use the SML/NJ system.
<p>

<DL>
<A NAME="starting"></A>
<DT><strong>How do I start SML?</strong> <DD>
<P>
Under Unix, you should make sure that the bin directory containing
the sml command is in your path (defined by the PATH shell variable).
If SMLHOME is defined to be the directory where SML/NJ was installed,
then the sml command would be $SMLHOME/bin/sml.  Another common place
where the sml command might be installed is the directory /usr/local/bin.
You can invoke sml by giving a full file name
<pre>
  /usr/local/bin/sml
</pre>
or, if the sml command is in a directory in your path, just type:
<pre>
  sml
</pre>
<p>
Under Windows, you can run SML/NJ by double clicking on the SML icon.
Or ...
<p>
<A NAME="quiting"></A>
<DT><strong>How do I quit SML?</strong> <DD>
<P>
Typing the EOF character at the interactive top level will quit sml.
The EOF key is typically ctrl-D under Unix and ctrl-Z under Windows,
where you'll need to press the return/enter key to make it take
effect.  Another method is to call the function
<code>OS.Process.exit</code>:
<pre>
  OS.Process.exit(OS.Process.success);
</pre>
The two status values definied in <code>OS.Process</code> are
<code>success</code> and <code>failure</code>.
See the <a href="../basis/pages/os-process.html"><code>OS.Process</code></a>
documentation.  The <code>OS.Process.exit</code> function is the
proper means of quiting sml from within a program.
<p>
<A NAME="loadFile"></A>
<DT><strong>How do I load a program from a file?</strong> <DD>
<p>
The function
<pre>
  use: string -> unit
</pre>
is defined at top level and will load a file containing SML source
code if applied to a string containing the name of the file (i.e. a
file path name in the syntax of the host operating system).  For
instance
<pre>  
  use "../lib/sort.sml";
</pre>  
would cause the contents of the file "<code>../lib/sort.sml</code>" (assuming Unix
file name syntax) to be loaded into the top-level interactive system
as though it had been typed or pasted into the top-level interactive
loop.
<p>
The function name <code>use</code> is a top-level synonym for the
function <a href="../Compiler/pages/interact.html#SIG:INTERACT.useFile:VAL:SPEC">
<code>Compiler.Interact.useFile</code></a>.
<p>
The <code>use</code> function is convenient and adaquate for casual
use, but it is not the recommended way to load an entire multifile
program.  For serious program development, it is much better to use
the facilities of the compilation manager,
<a href="../CM/index.html"><strong>CM</strong></a>.
<p>
<A NAME="loadLib"></A>
<DT><strong>How do I load libraries?</strong><DD>
<p>
It depends on what you mean by "load".  A brute force method would be
to determine the pathname of the source code for the library and load
the source code with the "use" command, but this is not recommended.
A much better technique is to use <a href="../CM/index.html">CM</a>,
the built-in Compilation Manager.
<p>
If you want to use a library as part of a CM-managed program,
then you simply list the library's description file in your own
project's description file.
<p>
If you want to be able to access the bindings that the library exports
at the interactive prompt, then you must issue the command:
<pre>
  CM.make' ("&lt;library-description-file&gt;", false);
</pre>
or, if you are using the latest "working" version of SML/NJ (110.9 or later):
<pre>
  CM.make' { group = "&lt;library-description-file&gt;",
             force_relink = false };
</pre>
Of course, you must replace the placeholder
<code>&lt;library-description-file&gt;</code> with the pathname of the
library's description file (note that CM uses the shell environment
variable CM_PATH when looking for description files).  If the pathname
of the library happens to be simply "sources.cm", then you don't need
to specify it at all.  In that case simply say
<pre>
  CM.make ();
</pre>
<p>
CM also provides an <em>autoloading feature</em>, which causes selected
library modules to be loaded automatically when they are mentioned in
the interactive system.  By default, the Util and Unix sections of
the SML/NJ Library are registered for autoloading when the SML/NJ
system is built.  This means that if you refer to any of these library 
modules in code entered into the interactive system (directly or via
the function <code>use</code>), they will be loaded automatically by
CM.  Which libraries are initially registered for autoloading is
determined by variables set in the config/targets file, but users can
register their own libraries for autoloading using the <code>CM.autoload'</code>
function.
<p>
See the <a href="../CM/index.html">CM manual</a> for further information.
<p>

<a name="getDir"></a>
<dt><strong>How do I determine the current directory of the SML process?
</strong><dd>
<p>
The function <code>OS.FileSys.getDir</code> returns the current 
directory of the interactive loop or of an SML program that calls it.
<p>

<a name="chDir"></a>
<dt><strong>How do I change the current directory of the SML process?</strong><dd>
<p>
The function <code>OS.FileSys.chDir</code> sets the current 
directory of the interactive loop or of an SML program that calls it.
<p>

<A NAME="saveImage"></A>
<DT><strong>How do I save an SML image?</strong><DD>
<p>
To save a heap-image of the SML/NJ interactive system, use the function
<pre>
  <A HREF="../SMLofNJ/pages/smlnj.html#SIG:SML_OF_NJ.exportML:VAL">exportML</A>: string -> bool
</pre>
which is defined in the
<A HREF="../SMLofNJ/pages/smlnj.html"><code>SMLofNJ</code></A>
structure.  A call such as
<pre>
  exportML "image"
</pre>
causes a heap image to be saved as <code>image.<i>arch-opsys</i></code> where
<code><i>arch-opsys</i></code> designates the architecture and
operating system (e.g. <code>image.sparc-solaris</code>).  The original
call of <code>exportML</code> returns false.
<p>
<A NAME="runImage"></A>
<DT><strong>How do I run a saved SML image?</strong><DD>
<p>
Having created a heap image file, say <code>image.<i>arch-opsys</i></code>
with the 
<A HREF="../SMLofNJ/pages/smlnj.html#SIG:SML_OF_NJ.exportML:VAL">exportML</A>
function, you can run the image, resuming the interactive loop from
the point where <code>exportML</code> was called by executing
<pre>
  sml @SMLload=image.<i>arch-opsys</i>
</pre>
(where <code><i>arch-opsys</i></code> will be a particular
architecture, operating system combination like
"<code>sparc-solaris</code>"), or just
<pre>
  sml @SMLload=image
</pre>
since <code>sml</code> can figure out the right <code><i>arch-opsys</i></code>
suffix.
Execution will
resume at the point where <code>exportML</code> returned, with the return value
being true to indicate that we are in the resumed image.
<p>
<A NAME="standAlone"></A>
<DT><strong>How do I create a stand-alone SML application?</strong><DD>
<p>
To create a stand-alone application, use the function
<pre>
  <A HREF="../SMLofNJ/pages/smlnj.html#SIG:SML_OF_NJ.exportFn:VAL">exportFn</A>: (string * ((string * string list) -> OS.Process.status)) -> unit 
</pre>
which is defined in the
<A HREF="../SMLofNJ/pages/smlnj.html"><code>SMLofNJ</code></A>
structure.  This function also produces a heap image file that must
be passed as an <code>@SMLload</code> parameter to <code>sml</code> to be run.
If you want to create a simple executable image, see the
<a href="#executable">following question</a>.
<p>
<A NAME="executable"></A>
<DT><strong>How do I create an executable image for an SML/NJ application?</strong><DD>
<p>
It is possible to combine a heap image with the SML/NJ runtime to
create a normal executable file by using Lorenz Huelsbergen's
<a href="../heap2exec/index.html"> heap2exec</a> utility.
