<a name="versions"></a>
<dt><b>What versions of Windows does SML/NJ run on?</b>
	
<dd>	Windows 95
<dd>	Windows NT (versions 3.51 and 4.0)

<p>
<a name="distribution"></a>
<dt><b>How is the Windows version of SML/NJ distributed?</b>

<dd>
<UL>
<LI> As a self-installing .EXE for Windows 95 or NT. <br>
<a href="ftp://ftp.research.bell-labs.com/dist/smlnj/release/110/110-smlnj.exe">ftp.research.bell-labs.com:/dist/smlnj/release/110/110-smlnj.exe</a>
<p>
<LI> As a set of Unix compressed tar files that can be used for manual
installation.

<dd>	The Windows version of the compiler is fully integrated with the
	source distrbution.  Therefore, you may also want to fetch the 
	SML/NJ library:<br>

<a href="ftp://ftp.research.bell-labs.com/dist/smlnj/release/110/110-smlnj-lib.tar.Z">ftp.research.bell-labs.com:/dist/smlnj/release/110/110-smlnj-lib.tar.Z</a>


<p>
<a name="tools"></a>
<dt><b>What tools are required to manually install SML/NJ on Windows?</b>

<dd>	Windows versions of the "GNU unzip" (<tt>gunzip</tt>) 
	and "tape archive" (<tt>tar</tt>)
	programs are required to uncompress and unbundle.  

<p>
<dd>
(<tt>tar</tt> and <tt>gunzip</tt> for win32 are freely available from <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.washington.edu/pub/ntemacs/utilities"> ftp.cs.washington.edu:/pub/ntemacs/utilities</a>.)

<p>
<dd>	Alternately, you can uncompress and untar on a Unix platform and 
	then move the resulting directory to Windows (via removable media,
	shared files, etc.).

<p>
<a name="install"></a>
<dt><b>Now that I have the binaries, gunzip and tar, how do I do the install?</b>

<dd>	Select and create a directory for the installation.  
	Here we'll use 
<pre>
	c:\smlnj\ 
</pre>

but any valid directory name of your choosing will do.

<p>
<dd>	Create an environment variable called <tt>SMLNJ_HOME</tt> 
	and set it to <tt>c:\smlnj\</tt>

<p>
	In NT, environment variables are usually set via 
	<tt>ControlPanel->System</tt>.  
	In Windows 95, they may be set per session with the DOS <tt>set</tt> 
	command from a shell prompt or, more persistently, 
	by placing a <tt>set</tt> command in 
	the <tt>autoexec.bat</tt> startup file:

<pre>
		set SMLNJ_HOME=c:\smlnj\
		set PATH=c:\smlnj\bin\
</pre>


<p>
<dd>	Place the <tt>110-win32-smlnj.tar.gz</tt> file in <tt>c:\smlnj\</tt>
	<br>
	Uncompress this file; i.e.:

<pre>
	c:\smlnj\> gunzip 110-win32-smlnj.tar.gz
</pre>

<p>
<dd>	Then untar the resulting tar file; i.e.:

<pre>
	c:\smlnj\> tar -xvf 110-win32-smlnj.tar
</pre>
		
<p>
<dd>	This will create the <tt>c:\smlnj\bin\</tt> subdirectory.  
	This directory is structured similarly to the Unix distributions 
	of SML/NJ.  
	That is, scripts to run the compiler (<tt>sml</tt>, <tt>sml-cm</tt>) 
	and the tools (<tt>ml-lex</tt>, <tt>ml-yacc</tt>, <tt>ml-burg</tt>)
	are in <tt>c:\smlnj\bin\</tt>, runtime executables are in 
	<tt>c:\smlnj\bin\.run\</tt> 
	and heap images are in <tt>c:\smlnj\bin\.heap\</tt>

<p>
<dd>	You may now want to put <tt>%SMLNJ_HOME%\bin\</tt> 
	in your <tt>PATH</tt>.

<p>
<dd>	To conserve space, you can remove heap images (in 
	<tt>%SMLNJ_HOME%\bin\.heap\</tt>) 
	corresponding to unneeded tools.  
	You can also use <tt>sml-cm</tt> in lieu of 
	<tt>sml</tt> (and remove <tt>sml</tt>); however, 
	<tt>sml-cm</tt> uses a bit more space (disk and memory).

<p>
<a name="run"></a>
<dt><b>How do I run the compiler under Windows?</b>
<dd>	From an MS-DOS prompt (or other shell), invoke the <tt>sml.bat</tt>, 
	<tt>sml-cm.bat</tt>, <tt>ml-lex.bat</tt>, <tt>ml-yacc.bat</tt> or
	<tt>ml-burg.bat</tt> 
	scripts to run the compiler and tools respectively.

<p>
<dd>	Note that if you did not place <tt>%SMLNJ_HOME%\bin\</tt> 
	in your <tt>PATH</tt>, you
	will need to give a full path to the scripts; e.g.:

<pre>
	c:\smlnj\bin\sml-cm
</pre>

<p>
<a name="smlnj-lib"></a>
<dt><b>How does this version interact with the SML/NJ library?</b>

<dd>	The Windows version of the compiler is fully integrated with the
	source distrbution.  Therefore, you may also want to fetch the 
	SML/NJ library:
<pre>
<a href="ftp://ftp.research.bell-labs.com/dist/smlnj/release/110/110-smlnj-lib.tar.Z">ftp.research.bell-labs.com:/dist/smlnj/working/110/110-smlnj-lib.tar.Z</a>
</pre>

	To install it, create a SML/NJ <tt>src</tt> directory (i.e. 
	<tt>c:\smlnj\src</tt>) and
	decompress and untar the above smlnj-lib distribution file there.

<p>
<a name="icon"></a>
<dt><b>How do I create a Windows icon for SML/NJ?</b>
<dd>	We currently do not have a custom icon for SML/NJ.  However,
	SML/NJ can be installed as a Windows <i>program item</i> and 
	Windows will assign a generic icon.

<p>
<dd>
	<b>NT 4.0 and Windows 95:</b> use <i>Explorer</i> to locate the
	file for which an icon is desired (e.g. <tt>sml-cm.bat</tt>
	in the <tt>c:\smlnj\bin\</tt> directory), select it, and
	create a shortcut for it (<tt>File->CreateShortcut</tt>).
	You can then rename this shortcut icon and place it elsewhere.
	Drag it to the desktop to place it there; click the right
	mouse button on the <i>task bar</i> and select <tt>Properties</tt>
	to place the SML/NJ icon in the <i>Start</i> menu.

<p>
<dd>	<b>NT 3.51:</b> using the program manager, 
	select the program group where you would like to
	install SML/NJ as an icon.  Then select 
	<tt>File->New->ProgramItem</tt>.  As a <i>Description</i>,
	choose a label for the icon (e.g. "SML/NJ").
	For the <i>Command Line</i> field, give the path to
	<tt>sml.bat</tt> (or <tt>sml-cm.bat</tt>); e.g.:
<pre>
	c:\smlnj\bin\sml-cm.bat
</pre>
	Set the <i>Working Directory</i> to the directory in which
	you want SML/NJ to start.


<p>
<a name="compiler"></a>
<dt><b>How do I compile the SML/NJ compiler under Win32?</b>

<dd>
<p>
If you desire to modify the compiler itself, you'll need some additional
tools to build it.  (The executables in the distribution suffice for
compiling SML programs.)

<p>
Compiling the runtime system requires the following tools:
<ul>
<li>MS Visual C++, 2.0 or later
<li>MS Assembler (MASM), 6.11 or later
<li>MS NMAKE (part of VC++), 1.50 or later
</ul>

<p>
It should be straightforward to build with other compilers, assemblers,
and "make" utilities (see <tt>src\runtime\objs\makefile.win32</tt> and <tt>src\runtime\objs\mk.x86-win32</tt>).

<p>
<dd>Compiling the SML compiler source requires <em>ksh</em> and common
Unix tools (<tt>sed</tt>, <tt>grep</tt>). We use MKS Toolkit for this,
although other <em>ksh</em> based toolkits should work directly as well;
e.g. <a href="http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/uwin/">UWIN</a>.

<p>
<dd>Here we assume that you have the SML/NJ compiler sources. (The Win32
version uses the same source tree as the Unix versions.)  

<p>
<dd>Ensure that the compiler, assembler, and "make" utility are in your path.

<p>
<dd>Compile the runtime by issuing
<pre>
    nmake /f mk.x86-win32
</pre>
in SML/NJ's <tt>src\runtime\objs</tt> directory.
This will create <tt>run.x86-win32.exe</tt> which is usually placed in 
the <tt>smlnj\bin\.run</tt> directory.

<p>
<dd>Compiling the compiler proper requires a set of "bin" files retargeted
for Windows.  For the x86, this directory is called <tt>bin.x86-win32</tt> and
is distributed as:
<pre>
<a href="ftp://ftp.research.bell-labs.com/dist/smlnj/release/110/110-bin.x86-win32.tar.Z">ftp.research.bell-labs.com:/dist/smlnj/release/110/110-bin.x86-win32.tar.Z</a>
</pre>
(You can create this set of <tt>bin</tt> files by retargeting the compiler,
with CM, to cross-compile, e.g. from a Unix platform,
to the <tt>win32</tt> OS.)
Place <tt>bin.x86-win32</tt> in <tt>src\sml-nj</tt>.
Set the working directory to <tt>src\sml-nj</tt> and, from a 
<em>ksh</em>
prompt, issue the command:
<pre>
    xmakeml -boot bin.x86-win32
</pre>
This will produce the image <tt>sml.x86-win32</tt> which is usually placed in
<tt>bin\.heap</tt>

<p>
<dd>SML/NJ tools are built analogously to the Unix versions.  That is,
the command
<pre>
    build
</pre>
is issued in the respective tool directory.  Note that SML/NJ's <tt>bin</tt>
directory must be in the path for the default <tt>build</tt> command to 
find the compiler and tools.
