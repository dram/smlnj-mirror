    <h1>SML/NJ-C Foreign Function Interface Library</h1>
<p>
The documentation for this library consists of the
<a href="README">README</a> file (found at src/smlnj-c/README in the
source distribution),
and the paper
<a href="smlnj-c.ps"><em>A Portable C Interface for Standard ML of New
Jersey</em> (postscript, 204KB)</a>.  The abstract of this paper
reads:
<blockquote>
This paper describes the design and implementation of an interface to
C for the SML/NJ ML compiler.  The interface supplies ML datatypes
with which programmers specify C types and C data. An ML program uses
these datatypes to register a foreign C function with the interface
and to build specifications of structured C data. The interface
automatically instantiates C function arguments from C data
specifications upon foreign function application. Most C types,
including aggregate and function-pointer types, are supported.  A
runtime code generation technique converts ML closures to C-callable
function pointers.  Function pointers allow C programs to call ML
programs.  We solve the problems due to differences in data
representation, function calling conventions, and storage management
by copying data between the ML and C heaps, converting
representations and changing calling conventions in the process. We
find that this copying strategy provides adequate performance in
practice.  The interface is portable in the sense that its
implementation does not require changes to the SML/NJ compiler proper;
it is isolated in a pair of libraries (ML and C).  The interface has
already found use in several non-trivial applications.
