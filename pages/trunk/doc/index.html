<blockquote>
Standard ML of New Jersey (SML/NJ) is a compiler, interactive
system, and programming environment for the Standard ML language.
This document is a guide to programming in Standard ML using SML/NJ.
<p>

<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>
Several very useful <a href="literature.html#books">books</a>
on the Standard ML programming language are available, and a number of
Standard ML <a href="literature.html#tutorials">tutorials</a> can be
found on line.  The <a href="news:comp.lang.ml">comp.lang.ml</a> and 
<a href="news:comp.lang.functional">comp.lang.functional</a> newsgroups
are also a good source of information, help, and news, and these
newsgroups maintain associated <a href="literature.html#other">FAQs</a>.
Our <a href="literature.html">literature</a> page summaries these general
information sources.

<h2>Using Standard ML of New Jersey</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a href="../software.html">Obtaining the SML/NJ Software</a></strong><dd>
SML/NJ is available for free via internet ftp or the web.  It's use
is governed by a very liberal <a href="../license.html">license</a>.

<dt><strong><a href="../install/index.html">Installing SML/NJ</a></strong><dd>
Installing SML/NJ under under Unix is easy, and generally just
requires downloading the files and running a shell script.  Installation
under Windows is even easier using the self-installing ".exe" file.

<dt><strong><a href="FAQ/index.html">The SML/NJ FAQ</a></strong><dd>
A FAQ for SML/NJ is currently under development but is still very
fragmentary.

<dt><strong><a href="interact.html">The SML/NJ Interactive System</a></strong>
<dd>
How to get started with <tt>sml</tt>, how to compile and
run programs.

<dt><strong><a href="CM/index.html">Compilation Manager</a></strong> <dd>
The SML/NJ compilation manager <strong>CM</strong> organizes and
optimizes the compilation process.  CM calculates and caches the
dependence graph between modules.  When a module has been edited and
is recompiled, CM compares the export type-signature of the new module
to that of the old, to minimize the number of modules that are
recompiled.  The CM Manual is also available in <a
href="CM/manual.ps"> Postscript</a>.

<dt><strong><a href="errors.html">SML/NJ Error Messages</a></strong><dd>
An explanation of the error messages printed by the SML/NJ compiler.

<dt><strong><a href="features.html">Special features of SML/NJ</a></strong>
<dd>Standard ML of New Jersey supports some extensions to the
Standard ML language, such as first-class continuations, higher-order
functors, and so on.

<dt><strong><a href="SMLofNJ/index.html">The SMLofNJ structure</a></strong>
<dd>This structure contains runtime-system interface and operating-system
interface functions that are not part of the international standard.

<dt><strong><a href="Compiler/pages/compiler.html">The Compiler structure</a></strong>
<dd>This structure contains user-settable flags to control the
operation of the compiler and interactive system, and also interfaces
to individual phases of the SML/NJ compiler.

<dt><strong><a href="Conversion/index.html">SML '97 Conversion Guide</a></strong><dd>
The Standard ML '97 language is almost, but not quite, compatible
with the 1990 definition supported by earlier versions of SML/NJ;
the conversion guide explains the differents, and gives examples
of how to upgrade existing SML'90 programs.

<dt><strong><a href="Conversion/top-level-comparison.html">Top Level Environment Comparison</a></strong><dd>
A comparison of the SML/NJ 0.93 and SML/NJ 110 top level environments.
</dl>

<h2>Basic Libraries</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a href="http://www.standardml.org/Basis/index.html">
The Standard ML Basis Library</a></strong>
<dd>This describes the "library" functions and interfaces
that are part of the ML standard.  This includes modules for
I/O, operating-system interface, arithmetic on integers, reals,
and words (unsigned integers), mathematical functions, operations on
strings and substrings, and so on.

<dt><strong><A HREF="smlnj-lib/index.html">The Standard ML of New Jersey Library</A></strong>
<dd>The SML/NJ Library contains library and utility functions that
are not part of the standard Standard.  The SML/NJ library
includes modules for binary search trees, adjustable arrays,
and other useful data structures in the Util directory.  The
Unix directory supplies additional Unix-specific features,
while the HTML directory supports processing web pages.
</dl>

<h2>Programming Tools and Libraries</h2>
<dl>
<dt><a href="ML-Lex/manual.html">ML-Lex</a><dd>
A lexical-analyzer generator similar to the classic Unix lex.
<dt><a href="ML-Yacc/index.html">ML-Yacc</a><dd>
A parser generator similar to the classic Unix yacc, but with
syntax error repair features.
<dt><a href="http://cml.cs.uchicago.edu/">Concurrent ML</a>
<dd>
A library adding concurrency to SML.
<dt><a href="http://www.cis.ksu.edu/~stough/eXene/index.html">eXene</a>
<dd>
An X-windows based graphical interface toolkit.
<dt><a href="SMLNJ-C/index.html">SML/NJ C Interface Library</a><dd>
Lorenz Huelsbergen's library for building SML interfaces to C
libraries and programs.
<dt><strong><a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/leunga/www/MLRISC/Doc/html/index.html">MLRISC</a></strong><dd>
The SML/NJ compiler uses Lal George's MLRISC code generation framework
(currently for Alpha and HPPA architectures, but eventually for all
architectures).  MLRISC is being developed as an independent tool for
building highly modular optimizing code generators, and is currently
being used in a number of other compilers and compiler research projects.

<h2><a href="Emacs/sml-mode.html">Emacs Editing and Interaction
Support</a></h2> Documentation for version 3.3 of Matthew J. Morley's
sml-mode for Gnu emacs and Xemacs, which supports editing SML source
code and interacting with <code>sml</code> under emacs.  Sml-mode is
now maintained by Stefan Monnier (monnier at iro dot umontreal dot
ca), and the latest version is available at
<a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~monnier/elisp/">
