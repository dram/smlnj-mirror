<H1>Special Features of SML/NJ</H1>
<blockquote>
<h2>Extra top-level structures</h2>
Standard ML of New Jersey provides the complete
<a href="basis/index.html">SML'97
Basis Library</a>, and in addition provides several other library
modules.
<p>
The <a href="SMLofNJ/pages/smlnj.html">SMLofNJ</a> structure contains substructures
that provide:
<menu>
<li><a href="SMLofNJ/pages/internals.html">access to compiler internals</a>,
<li><a href="SMLofNJ/pages/weak.html">weak pointers</a>,
<li><a href="SMLofNJ/pages/susp.html">lazy suspensions</a>,
<li><a href="SMLofNJ/pages/cont.html">first-class continuations</a>,
<li><a href="SMLofNJ/pages/interval-timer.html">interval timers</a>, and
<li><a href="SMLofNJ/pages/sysinfo.html">information about the underlying system</a>.
</menu>
<p>
Other top-level structures provide:
<menu>
<li><a href="SMLofNJ/pages/unsafe.html">unsafe operations (such as unchecked array access)</a>,
<li><a href="SMLofNJ/pages/signals.html">general operating system signal values</a>,
<li><a href="SMLofNJ/pages/unix-signals.html">unix-specific signal values</a>,
<li><a href="SMLofNJ/pages/poll.html">control of automatic compiler-generated polling</a>,
<li><a href="SMLofNJ/pages/cleanup.html">hooks for cleanup operations at ML exit and restart</a>,
and 
<li><a href="SMLofNJ/pages/cinterface.html">interface to runtime-system functions</a>.
</menu>
<p>
SML/NJ also provides access to the internal phases of the
<a href="Compiler/pages/compiler.html">compiler</a> itself.
There are substructures for:
<menu>
<li><a href="Compiler/pages/profile.html">execution profiling</a>,
<li><a href="Compiler/pages/prettyprint.html">user-customizable pretty printing</a>,
<li><a href="Compiler/pages/printcontrol.html">control of compiler
error-message printing</a>, and
<li><a href="Compiler/pages/mccontrol.html">control of warning messages</a>.
</menu>
Other features of the compiler provide access to the SML/NJ "visible
compiler", including environments, syntax trees (Ast), abstract syntax
(Absyn), parsing, and other basic compilation operations.  These
"visible compiler" structures are not yet documented, other than by
source code for the signatures.

<h2>Vector expressions and patterns</h2>
Vectors are homogeneous, immutable arrays
(see the <a href="basis/pages/vector.html">Vector</a> structure).
Vectors are a standard feature of SML'97, but SML/NJ also has special
syntax for vector expressions and vector patterns.
In SML'97, vectors can be created only by calling functions
from the Vector structure, and cannot be pattern-matched.
<p>
The vector expression 
<pre>
  #[<i>exp</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>exp</i><sub>1</sub>, ..., <i>exp</i><sub><i>n</i>-1</sub>]
</pre>
(where <i>n</i> &gt;= 0) creates a vector of length <i>n</i> whose
elements are the values of the corresponding subexpressions.  As with
other aggregate expressions, the element expressions are evaluated
from left to right.  Vectors may be pattern-matched by vector patterns
of the form 
<pre>
  #[<i>pat</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>pat</i><sub>1</sub>, ..., <i>pat</i><sub><i>n</i>-1</sub>]
</pre>
Such a pattern will only match a vector value
of the same length.
<p>
Vector expressions and vector patterns are more compact and efficient
than lists, and are comparable in cost to records.

<h2>Or-patterns</h2>
SML/NJ has also extended the syntax of patterns to allow 
``or-patterns.''
The basic syntax is:
<pre>
  (<i>apat</i><sub>1</sub> | ... | <i>apat</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>)
</pre>
where the <i>apat</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> are atomic patterns.
The other restriction is that the variables bound in each 
<i>apat</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>
must be the same, and have the same type.
A simple example is:
<pre>
  fun f ("y"|"yes") = true
    | f _ = false;
</pre>
which has the same meaning as:
<pre>
  fun f "y" = true
    | f "yes" = true
    | f _ = false;
</pre>

<h2>First-class continuations</h2>

A set of primitives has been added to ML to give access to continuations:
<pre>
  structure <a href="SMLofNJ/pages/cont.html">SMLofNJ.Cont</a> : sig
    type 'a cont
    val callcc : ('a cont -> 'a) -> 'a
    val throw : 'a cont -> 'a -> 'b
    . . .
  end
</pre>
The continuation of an expression is an abstraction of what the system
will do with the value of the expression. 
<p>
The use of <strong>callcc</strong> is described with structure 
<a href="SMLofNJ/pages/cont.html"><code>SMLofNJ.Cont</code></a>.

<h2>Quote/Antiquote</h2>

An early use of ML was as a <strong>M</strong>eta<strong>L</strong>anguage
for manipulating terms in an object language.  Edinburgh LCF/ML
had features to parse one particular object language (called OL).
Standard ML of New Jersey has 
<a href="quote.html">support for arbitrary object languages,
with user supplied object-language parsing</a>.

<h2>Higher-order Modules</h2>

The module system of Standard ML has supported <i>first-order</i>
parametric modules in the form of <i>functors</i>.  But there are
occasions when one like to parameterize over functors as well as
structures, which requires a truly higher-order module system (see,
for instance, the <a href="powerset.sml">powerset functor example</a>.
SML/NJ now provides a
higher-order extension of the module system.
<p>
Parameterization over functors can be provided in a straightforward
way by allowing functors to be components of structures.
Syntactically this can be accomplished merely by allowing functor
declarations inside of structure bodies, and by providing syntax for
functor specifications in signatures.  Functor specifications were
already part of the module syntax of the Definition of Standard ML
(Figure 8, p. 14), so we have implemented that syntax and added it to
the <i>spec</i> class (Figure 7, p. 13).  In addition, it is convenient
to have a way of declaring functor signatures and some syntactic
sugar for curried functor definitions and partial application of
curried functors, so these have also been provided.  This extension
is an ``upward-compatible'' enrichment of the language that should
break no existing programs.
<p>
<strong>Functors as structure components.</strong>
In the extended language, a signature can contain a functor specification:
<pre>
  signature SIG =
  sig
    type t
    val a : t
    functor F(X: sig type s
		     val b: s
		 end) : sig val x : t * X.s end
  end
</pre>
To match such a signature, a structure is allowed to contain a functor
declaration:
<pre>
  structure S : SIG =
  struct
    type t = int
    val a = 3
    functor F(X: sig type s val b: s end) = 
      struct val x = (a,X.b) end
  end
</pre>
This makes it possible higher-order functors by including a functor as
a component of a parameter structure or of a result structure.  The case
of a functor parameter is illustrated by the following example.
<pre>
  signature MONOID = 
  sig
    type t
    val plus: t*t -> t
    val e: t
  end;

  (* functor signature declaration *)
  funsig PROD (structure M: MONOID
	       structure N: MONOID) = MONOID

  functor Square(structure X: MONOID
		 functor Prod: PROD): MONOID =
      Prod(structure M = X
	   structure N = X);

</pre>
Note that this example involves the definition of a <em>functor
signature</em> <code>PROD</code>.
Currently functor signature declarations take one of the following forms:
<pre>
  funsig <i>funid</i> (<i>strid</i>: <i>sigexp</i>) = <i>sigexp}</i>
  funsig <i>funid</i> (<i>specs</i>) = <i>sigexp</i>
</pre>
This syntax is viewed as provisional and subject to change.
<p>
A common use of functors returning functors in their result is to
approximate a curried functor with multiple parameters.  Here is
how one might define a curried monoid product functor:
<pre>
  functor CurriedProd (M: MONOID) =
  struct
    functor Prod1 (N: MONOID) : MONOID =
      struct
	type t = M.t * N.t
	val e = (M.e, N.e)
	fun plus((m1,n1),(m2,n2))=(M.plus(m1,m2),N.plus(n1,n2))
      end;
  end
</pre>
This works, but the partial application of this functor is rather 
awkward because it requires the explicit creation of an intermediate
structure:
<pre>
  structure IntMonoid =
  struct
    type t = int
    val e = 0
    val plus = (op +): int*int -> int
  end;

  structure Temp = CurriedProd(IntMonoid);

  functor ProdInt = Temp.Prod1;
</pre>
To simplify the use of this sort of functor, some derived forms
provide syntactic sugar for curried functor definition and partial
application.  Thus the above example can be written:
<pre>
  functor CurriedProd (M: MONOID) (N: MONOID) : MONOID =
  struct
    type t = M.t * N.t
    val e = (M.e, N.e)
    fun plus((m1,n1),(m2,n2))=(M.plus(m1,m2),N.plus(n1,n2))
  end;

  functor ProdInt = CurriedProd(IntMonoid);
</pre>

The syntax for curried forms of functor signature and functor declarations
and for the corresponding partial applications can be summarized
as follows:
<pre>
  funsig <i>funsigid</i> (<i>par</i><sub>1</sub>) ... (<i>par</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>) = <i>sigexp</i>

  functor <i>funid</i> (<i>par</i><sub>1</sub>) ... (<i>par</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>) = <i>strexp</i>

  functor <i>funid1</i> = <i>funid2</i> (<i>arg</i><sub>1</sub>) ... (<i>arg</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>)

  structure <i>strid</i> = <i>funid</i> (<i>arg</i><sub>1</sub>) ... (<i>arg</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>)
</pre>
where
<pre>
  <i>par</i> ::= <i>id</i> : <i>sigexp</i> | <i>specs</i>
  <i>arg</i> ::= <i>strexp</i> | <i>dec</i>
</pre>
In the case of a partial application defining a functor, it is assumed
that the <i>funid2</i> on the right hand side takes more than <i>n</i>
arguments, while in the case of the structure declaration <i>funid</i>
should take exactly <i>n</i> arguments.  As a degenerate case where <i>n</i>=0
we have identity functor declarations:
<pre>
  functor <i>funid1</i> = <i>funid2</i>
</pre>
There is also a "let" form of functor expression:
<pre>
  <i>fctexp</i> ::= let <i>dec</i> in <i>fctexp</i> end
</pre>
which can only be used in functor definitions of the form:
<pre>
  functor <i>funid</i> = let <i>dec</i> in <i>fctexp</i> end.
</pre>
<p>
The curried functor declaration
<pre>
  functor F (<i>par</i><sub>1</sub>) ... (<i>par</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>) = <i>strexp</i>
</pre>
is a derived form that is translated into the following declaration
<pre>
  functor F (<i>par</i><sub>1</sub>) =
  struct
    functor %fct% (<i>par</i><sub>2</sub>) ... (<i>par</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>) = <i>strexp</i>
  end
</pre>
and the declarations
<pre>
  structure S = F (<i>arg</i><sub>1</sub>) ... (<i>arg</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>)
  functor G = F (<i>arg</i><sub>1</sub>) ... (<i>arg</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>)
</pre>
are derived forms expanding into (respectively):
<pre>
  local
    structure %hidden% = F (<i>arg</i><sub>1</sub>)
  in
    structure S = %hidden%.%fct% (<i>arg</i><sub>2</sub>) ... (<i>arg</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>)
  end
</pre>
and
<pre>
  local
    structure %hidden% = F (<i>arg</i><sub>1</sub>) ... (<i>arg</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>)
  in
    functor G = %hidden%.%fct%
  end
</pre>
Currently there is no checking that a complete set of arguments is
supplied when a curried functor is applied to define a structure,
as illustrated by the following example:
<pre>
  functor Foo (X: sig type s end) (Y: sig type t end) =
  struct type u = X.s * Y.t end

  structure A = struct type s = int end

  structure S = Foo (A)  (* Foo A yields a (useless) structure *)

  functor G = Foo (A)    (* Foo A yields a functor *)
</pre>
Of course, the structure <code>S</code> defined in this way is useless,
since we cannot use the pseudo-identifier <code>%fct%</code> to select
its functor component.  Arity checking to prevent this sort of
error will be added in a future release.
