<center><h2>Summary:</h2></center>
  This version is intended to fix the installation and recompilation
  problems associated with 110.21. Along the way, various fixes 
  and (of course) enhancements were made. 

<hr>

<center><h2> CM </h2></center>
  <ul>
  <li> Added CM.symval and CMB.symval which let you define your own
   "CM variables" -- those that can be queried from CM's #if syntax.

  <p><li>
   MLRISC.cm and viscomp-lib.cm were modified so that if the symbol "LIGHT"
   is defined then CMB.deliver will not include cross-compilers.  This
   considerably speeds up compiler re-compilation and also gives you
   smaller library files (savings are roughly 1.5 MB).
  <p>
   The variable can be set like this:
  <pre>
   #set (CMB.symval "LIGHT") (SOME 1);
  </pre>
 
  <p><li>
    Changes to src/system/pathconfig and config/install.sh as suggested
   by Stefan Monnier.  However, the name "INSTALLDIR" is used  instead
   "prefix".
  </ul>

<hr>

<center><h2> X86</h2></center>
   The assembly file X86.prim.asm was converted to use the assyntax.h 
   file from the xfree86 distribution. Thus just one file needs to be
   maintained for both Unix and Windows platforms.
