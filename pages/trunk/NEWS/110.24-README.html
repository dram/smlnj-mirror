<center><h2>Summary:</h2></center>
  This version is primarily intended to introduce parallel and
  distributed compilation in CM. On a lightly loaded 533MHz 21164, the
  compiler compiled itself in <tt>7m36s</tt> (all times are real/wall-clock
  times). Using 4 similar, but remote machines in parallel, the 
  compile time was reduced to <tt>3m38s</tt> -- more than a factor of two.
  <p>  
  This release also includes further MLRISC infra-structure to support
  lcc to C--.

  <center><h3>Parallel and Distributed compilation</h3></center>

  <h4> Firing up on host machine </h4>

    To perform parallel compilations, you must attach "compile servers"
    to CM.  This is done using function CM.server_start with the
    following signature:
    <pre>
      val server_start :
	   { name: string,
	     pathtrans: (string -> string) option,
	     cmd: string * string list } -> bool,
	     pref : int
	    }
    </pre>
    <tt>name</tt> is a string uniquely identifying the server and <tt>cmd</tt> is
    a value suitable as argument to <tt>Unix.execute</tt>.  (Since you are 
    asking: no, there is only a dummy implementation of this for
    non-Unix systems.) 

    <p>
    If the path to the sml  executable is <tt>/path/to/smlnj/bin/sml</tt>,
    then a server process on the local machine  could be started by:
  
    <pre>
      CM.server_start
	  { name = "A", 
	    pathtrans = NONE,
	    cmd = ("/path/to/smlnj/bin/sml", ["@CMslave"]),
	    pref = 0
           };
    </pre>

    The command line argument <tt>@CMslave</tt> puts sml into "slave
     mode". 
    <tt>pref</tt> is a numeric rating when choosing between idle slaves. Higher 
    values of pref are given greater preference.

  <h4>Firing up on remote machines</h4>

    To run a process on a remote machine, e.g., <tt>thatmachine</tt>, as
    compute server, you should be using something like <tt>rsh</tt>.  (You
    must specify the full path to <tt>rsh</tt> in the command because that's
    what Unix.execute wants. I.e., no PATH search. :-( ) The remote
    machine must share the file system with the local machine via
    something like NFS.
    <pre>
      CM.server_start
         { name = "thatmachine", 
	   pathtrans = NONE,
           cmd = ("/usr/ucb/rsh", 
	          ["thatmachine", "/path/to/smlnj/bin/sml",
                   "@CMslave"]) 
	   pref
          };
    </pre>

    You can start as many servers as you want, but they all must have
    different names.  If you attach any servers at all, then you should
    attach at least two (unless you want to attach one that runs on a
    machine vastly more powerful than your local one).  Local servers make
    sense on multi-CPU machines: start as many servers as there are CPUs.

  <h4>File paths</h4>

    For local servers, <tt>pathtrans</tt> can be safely left at <tt>NONE</tt>.  If
    you connect to a remote server, you can use <tt>pathtrans</tt> to specify
    a function for translating local absolute pathnames to remote
    absolute pathnames.  This can be a bit tricky to get right,
    especially if the machines use automounters and such.  Here is an
    area that definitely is only "alpha".

  <h4>Go for it</h4>

    After you have attached your servers, you should be able to do 
    <tt>CM.recomp</tt>, <tt>CM.make</tt>, <tt>CM.stabilize</tt>,
    <tt>CMB.make</tt>, <tt>CMB.deliver</tt>, etc.   
    as
    usual.  Cross-compilers ([Arch][OS]CMB.make ...) also work. If you
    are using <tt>CM.xxx</tt> functions, all attached servers must have
    the same architecture as your local one.  For <tt>CMB.xxx</tt> functions
    this requirement does not exist because there are cross-compilers
    available on the slave side, too. (I have not tested a
    mixed-architecture setup, though).

  <h4>Verbose</h4>

    For fun (or trouble-shooting), you can watch the master-slave 
    protocol by setting CM.debug to true (#set CM.debug true;)

  <h4>Races</h4>

    You might experience strange things in case of compile errors or
    interrupts. Please report bugs.  Attached servers should go
    away if you quit the contolling sml session. Warning: Be careful
    though, because this feature is a bit fragile.  If servers don't
    go away they tend to spin rapidly and suck up large quantities of
    CPU cycles. 

  <h4>PervEnv</h4>

    Since the protocol is fairly simple and brain-dead, it cannot
    handle complicated things like setting up the initial (pervasive)
    environment in the case of CMB.make.  Therefore, this will be done
    locally by the "master" process.

  <h4>Control-C</h4>

     When pressing ^C, you will experience a certain delay if servers
     are currently attached and busy.  This is because the
     interrupt-handling code will wait for the servers to finish what
     they are currently doing and bring them back to an "idle" state.

<center><h2> MLRISC</h2></center>

  <h4> BLOCK_NAME annotation</h4>
 
      During flowgraph generation, this annotation gives a user
      defined name to each basic block that is subsequently 
      generated. 

  <h4> EMPTY_BLOCK annotation</h4>

      SSA conversion requires an empty block at nodes that are global
      entry points as well as entry points from within the cluster. 
      The <tt>EMPTY_BLOCK</tt> annotation forces an empty basic block. Note
      that defining two labels consecutively does not create an empty
      block.

  <h4> asm-show-cellset </h4>

    The flag <tt>asm-show-cellset</tt> will list the definition and uses
    of CALL instructions during assembly listing.

  <h4> CVTI2I </h4>

    <tt>MLTREE.CVTI2I</tt> did needless sign-extension when converting from 32
    to 64 bits, and <tt>CVTI2I</tt> explicitly mentions the size of the source
    and destination.

  <h4> MLTREE </h4>

    <tt>MLTREE</tt> and related signatures have been simplified so that the
    large number of where clauses used in several places are no longer 
    required.
