  	This working version is believed to be stable, but
	we have not run our full regression-test suite.

<dt>Summary:
<dd>A number of small, but important bug fixes.</dd>
</dl>

<hr>

<h3>Details:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in <t>MatchTree.nth</t> (regexp library).
<li>Fixed a long-standing memory leak in the GC where a program
	with fixed-sized live data could suffer from unbounded VM
	growth (bugs 1119 and 1131).  Note that we thought that this
	bug was fixed in 110.40, but we were wrong.
<li>Fixed inlined versions of <t>Real.min</t> and <t>Real.max</t>.
<li>Resurrected <t>SMLofNJ.Internals.BTrace.mode</t>, which had gone missing.
<li>Added missing implementation of <t>IEEEReal.fromString</t>.
<li>Added missing implementations of
    <t>OS.Path.</t>{<t>from</t>,<t>to</t>}<t>UnixPath</t>.
<li>Exported structure <t>BTImp</t> from
	<t>$smlnj/viscomp/debugprof.cm</t> so that other clients can
	set up backtracing support.
</ul>
