<h2> Warning </h2>

 <blockquote>
 <blockquote>
    <em>
  	This version is intended for compiler hackers.  
	We are in the midst of substantial structural changes, 
	and this is a snapshot.  It only  supports the Sparc, 
	Alpha, HPPA, and PowerPC architectures.  Furthermore, 
	there are performance bugs that have to be fixed.

<h2>Summary</h2>
  This version contains a new and simplified interface between
  the code generator and runtime system. 

<hr>

<h2>GC API</h2>

  The basic idea is that all communication to the runtime system
  is through a fixed set of registers. Anything extra must be 
  bundled up and saved in one of these fixed registers. This 
  simplifies the runtime system significantly, and reduces the
  overhead of getting into (and out of) C. The net result is
  a 4% improvement in compiling the compiler on the DEC Alpha.

  <p>
  See the paper GC-API under
    <a href="../compiler-notes/index.html">Compiler notes</a>.

<h2> MLRISC </h2>
  There is a new mechanism for setting flags and gathering statistics.
  Various flags and counters can be set at the interactive level, e.g.
  the following can be used to dump the flowgraph before register 
  allocation:

<pre>
	structure CG = Compiler.Control.MLRISC

	CG.getFlag "dump-cfg-before-ra" := true;
</pre>

  The currently implemented set of flags and counters are described in:

<pre>
	src/MLRISC/FLAGS
</pre>
