<center><h2>Summary:</h2></center>

  This version has a variety of changes to CM, MLRISC, the x86 back
  end, Library, and  some crucial bug fixes. In no specific order:
<hr>

<center><h2> Polyequal </h2></center>

  The compiler will now print a warning each time it generates a call
  to polyequal. Such calls, which are known to be expensive in practice, 
  can most of the time be  eliminated using a type constraint (but see
  bug1534). The warning messages can be turned off using:
<pre>
	Compiler.Control.CG.polyEqWarn := false;
</pre>

<hr>
<center><h2> Bug 1507 </h2></center>

  Bug 1507 which easily ranks as the most difficult and mysterious
  bug yet, is fixed.  See the bugs files for the saga of message 
  related to the bug.

<hr>
<center><h2> comp-lib </h2></center>

  The comp-lib directory is gone. Pretty printing is done using the 
  SML/NJ Library version, and most variants of integer sets were 
  replaced with red-black trees. Whatever was not directly supported 
  by the SML/NJ Library was moved to <tt>compiler/MiscUtil/library</tt>.

<hr>
<center><h2> MLRISC </h2></center>
   <h4> MLRISC GC type </h4>

      <ul>
      <li> GC type is now an abstract type parameter customizable by the client

      <li> A mechanism for incrementally generating GC code 
        after optimizations has been added.  
      </ul>

   <h4> MLRISC Code Generator (mlriscGen)</h4>

      <ul>
       <p><li> Annotation of GC type information is now supported.  
        This feature is enabled via the flag "mlrisc-gcsafety"

       <p><li> There is now a mechansim for splitting entries into a block:  
        given an entry block A, if there are internal control flow to A,
        then we split A into A and A', with internal control flow redirected
        to A'.  Splitting the entry block removes critical edges that cannot be 
        handledd by the backend.  This is necessary for SSA optimizations.
        This feature is enabled via the flag "split-entry-block"
      </ul>

   <h4> MLRISC Register Allocator</h4>

      <ul>
      <p><li>This new version employs an improved iterated coalescing algorithm,
        which speeds up allocation of huge compilation units.

      <p><li> The new RA also runs a "spill coloring" phase to compact 
        spill locations on the stack frame.  This makes it possible
        to compile very large compilation units.

      <p><li> The client interface has been altered. 

      <p><li> Descriptions of these changes are in :
	<pre>
	  http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj/compiler-notes
	</pre>
      </ul>

   <h4> MLRISC clusters/flowgraphs</h4>
 
       There is now a new mechanism for incrementally adding/replacing code.

   <h4> ML-Yacc</h4>

       The generated initialization code now spills less.  The old generated
       code caused problems on certain architectures (HP).

   <h4> Intel IA32</h4>
     This version uses a new register allocator for the x86.  Unlike
     the previous allocator which targets pseudo memory registers and
     coalesces memory using a two phase scheme, this one directly
     controls memory  coalescing in one single (but more complex)
     phase.  Compilation of the compiler has sped up by 20-24%  As a
     side benefit, the benchmarks are  also running faster on the
     average.  Here are the numbers:

</pre>

    <p>
    Each number represents an average of 6 runs.  These numbers are collected
    on a dual processor (400Mhz Pentium II 512K) Linux box with 1G of
    memory, and @SMLalloc=256k as the allocation parameter.
    <p>
    The generated code of the new allocator seems to be just as compact
    as the old one.  The heap image sizes generated by the two allocators
    are identical given the same set of compiler source code as input.


<hr>
<center><h2> CM </h2></center>

    The "sml" command accepts command-line parameters.
    These parameters must be names of files that contain either ML
    source code or CM library descriptions.  The distinction is made
    based upon the filename suffix (.sml and .sig = ML source, .cm =
    CM description). Files are processed left-to-right.  ML source
    code files are "use"d, CM files are either "CM.autoload"ed or
    given to "CM.make". "CM.autoload" is used until the first
    occurence of the "-m" flag which switches to "CM.make". The "-a"
    flag restores the default behavior ("CM.autoload").
<p>
  CM properly handles the exception that the elaborator throws in
  cases of semantic errors.  As a result, you don't see an unhandled
  exception at top-level anymore, and CM.keep_going also works.
<p>
  Filters are treated "correctly" during cutoff recompilation.
    If you have an ML source that exports two things (say, structures
    A and B) but one of them gets filtered out by an export filter,
    then the rest of the system does not get "infected" by changes to
    the part that it cannot see.  So if B is filtered away, then for
    the rest of the system, your source really looks like it only
    exports A.  Modifications to B do no longer lead to recompilation
    of other modules if they cannot actually "see" B because of some
    export filter.
<p>
    This behavior was always the intended one, but it has never
    actually worked so far (not under the old CM and not under the new
    one).  The fix actually required some tweaking of the pickler.
<p>
  Structure CM re-shaped and distinction between "minimal-cm.cm" and
  "full-cm.cm":
     The new "full" structure CM is cleaned up quite a bit and uses
     sub-structures to organize things.  This will probably be fleshed
     out more in the future.  Full documentation of this can be found at:
<pre>
       http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~blume/SMLNJ-DEV/manual.ps or
       http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~blume/SMLNJ-DEV/manual/index.html
</pre>

    The library host-cm.cm has been eliminated.  Its place is taken by
    two _new_ libraries: full-cm.cm and minimal-cm.cm.  The latter is
    initially registered at toplevel.

<p>
  CM's master-slave protocol made more robust against unexpected failures:
    This mainly robustifies CM's master-slave protocol against
    unexpected deaths of slave processes.  This is important because
    rsh tends to die when you press ^C -- at least on some systems.
    CM will now gracefully continue to utilize remaining compile
    servers in the event of some other servers going down.  If the
    last servers disappears, operation will automatically switch back
    to non-parallel mode.
<p>
  CM's internal cache logic cleaned up:
    It will also avoid spurious error messages about files belonging
    to multiple groups.
<p>
  CM's "Tools" structure (library "cm-tools.cm") cleaned up and made
  more flexible.
<p>
  Pre-loading of libraries during bootstrap can now be customized.
  For "makeml", the relevant file is in src/system/preloads.standard;
  for "install.sh" it is "config/preloads".

<hr>
<center><h2> Library-related changes </h2></center>

  Reorganization of the libraries that make up the compiler
    viscomp-lib.cm was split into a core part (viscomp-core.cm) and
    various machine-dependent siblings (viscomp-<arch>.cm). The
    dependence of host-cmb.cm on target-compilers.cm is eliminated so
    that you don't suck in stuff you don't need when you load it.
    This cleans up some of the .cm files quite nicely (all that "#if"
    goo is gone except in one place where structures CM and CMB are
    built.
    Also, the "LIGHT" variable is treated quite nicely in just one
    place.
    On the downside (if you consider this a downside), there are quite
    a few additional .cm files (and libraries).  In particular, there
    is now one library for each architecture (called
    <arch>-compiler.cm) and one library for each CMB
    (<arch>-<opsys>.cm).  As a result, you can re-target either
    summarily by loading target-compilers.cm (which is just the sum of
    the above) or by loading precisely the one CMB or the one Compiler
    that you need.
<p>
  All libraries except (viscomp-* and MLRISC-*) updated to eliminate
  all incomplete match warnings during compilation.

<hr>
<center><h2> Installation scripts </h2></center>

  The scripts "makeml" and "installml" are modified to automatically
  patch relevant "pathconfig" files.
<p>
  Default "bin" dir is now called sml.bin.<arch>-<os>; default "boot"
  dir is now called sml.boot.<arch>-<os>. Scripts are updated
  accordingly.
  (This seems to be more consistent with other naming conventions.)
<p>
  The "-bare" option to "makeml" works again.  Pre-loading of
  libraries into a "bare" system can be controlled using the
  src/system/preloads.bare file.
