<h2> Module System </h2>
<h3>1. Layered Redefinitions Ignored (Bug 1354 fixed)</h3>
<p>
Structure definition specs can easily give rise to redefinitions.  Consider 
the following example:
<pre>
  signature S1 =
  sig
    type t
  end;

  signature S2 =
  sig
    structure A : S1
    structure B : S1 = A
  end;

  signature S3 =
  sig
    structure C : S2
    structure D : S2 = C
  end;
</pre>
Here the substructure <code>D.B</code> of <code>S3</code> is defined
within <code>S2</code> in terms of <code>D.A</code>
(implying <code>D.B.t = D.A.t</code>), while by the definitional spec
in <code>S3</code>, <code>D.B</code> is
equal to <code>C.B</code> (implying <code>D.B.t = C.B.t</code>).
<p>
There are two ways of dealing with such secondary, or layered
definitional specs.
<ol>
  <li> Secondary definitions can be treated as errors (excepting
      those cases where the equivalence of the definitions can easily be
      verified).  This was the policy for 110.0.3 through 110.8, where
      examples like the above gave rise to the error message
      <pre>
        Error: possibly inconsistent structure definitions
      </pre>
      [This was bug 1354.]

  <li> The redefinitions can be regarded as producing implied sharing
      constraints (e.g. <code>D.A.t = C.B.t</code> in this case).
</ol>
In case (2), these implied sharing constraints will be verified
automatically during signature matching, in the process of matching
all the definitional specifications.  The question is whether they
should be taken into account (i.e. satisfied) when instantiating a
signature like <code>S3</code>.  We adopt the lenient policy of not dealing with
these implied constraints during instantiation.  Instead, during
instantiation secondary definitions are simply ignored.  In the
example, the inner definition <code>D.B.t = D.A.t</code> takes effect while the
secondary definition <code>D.B.t = C.B.t</code> is ignored.
<p>
The consequence of this policy is that some additional inconsistent
signatures will be successfully instantiated.  As usual, any attempt
to match these inconsistent signatures will fail.
<p>
The compiler flag
<pre>
  Compiler.Control.multDefWarn : bool ref
</pre>
controls whether a warning message will be generated when a secondary
definition is ignored.  It's default value is false, meaning no warning
messages will be produced.
<p>
We follow a stricter policy in some other cases, such as layered type
definition specs:
<pre>
  signature S = sig
    type t
    type s = t
  end where type s = int
</pre>
Here the secondary redefinition "where type s = int" is detected and
causes an error message.
<pre>
  Error: where type defn applied to definitional spec: s
</pre>
NOTE: This is an SML/NJ divergence, since the above signature is legal
in SML '97.  See Note "Sharable Types" below.



<h3>2. Noninterference of sharing and definitional specs</h3>
<p>
While the above solution relaxed a constraint enforced by the compiler,
this problem involves enforcing a new constraint relating to the
interaction between sharing and definitional specs.
<p>
The Definition requires that a type constructor involved in a sharing
constraint be (1) not defined as a type function, and (2) not
defined in terms of some "rigid" type constructor (i.e. a type
constructor previously defined in the context).
<p>
We choose to define "sharable" as meaning simply that there is {\em
no} definition applying to a type constructor.  We'll use the term
"defined" for the opposite of sharable.  A more subtle definition is
possible; see note "Sharable Types" below.
<p>
Thus the following signature is illegal
<pre>
  signature S =
  sig
    type s = int  (* s is defined *)
    type t        (* t is sharable *)
    sharing type t = s  (* s is not sharable *)
  end
</pre>
and has to be reexpressed as (for instance):
<pre>
  signature S =
  sig
    type s = int
    type t = s
  end
</pre>
With "where type" definitions, things are a little more complicated.  An
inner type sharing constraint can be affected by an outer definitional
constraint, as in the following example:
<pre>
  signature S1 =
  sig
    type s
    type t
    sharing type t = s  (* ok, because s and t are sharable here *)
  end
  where type t = int;  (* this converts both s and t to rigid types *)
</pre>
This is legal, but the following declaration is not:
<pre>
  signature S2 =
  sig 
    structure A : S1
    type v
    sharing type v = A.s  (* A.s not flexible *)
  end;
</pre>
However, S2 can easily be converted to the legal S3 below by
replacing the outer sharing constraint by a definition.
<pre>
  signature S3 =
  sig 
    structure A : S1
    type v = A.s
  end;
</pre>
In general, we recommend avoiding sharing constraints that can easily
be expressed by definitional specs.  So one should always prefer
<pre>
  type t = s
</pre>
to 
<pre>
  type t
  sharing type t = s.
</pre>
The same applies to structure sharing and structure definition specs
(which are an SML/NJ language extension).  Violations of this newly
enforced constraint can often be eliminated by replacing structure
sharing by structure definition specs, e.g. replacing
<pre>
  structure A : SIGA
  sharing A = B.C
</pre>
with
<pre>
  structure A : SIGA = B.C.
</pre>

<h4>SML/NJ Exception for Structure Sharing with Same Signature</h4>
<p>
SML/NJ provides one important exception to the rule about sharing rigid
types.  This is the case where the type sharing is implied by structure
sharing between two structures with the same signature.
<p>
Here is an example
<pre>
  signature S =
  sig
    type t = int
  end

  signature S1 =
  sig
    structure A : S
    structure B : S
    sharing A = B
  end
</pre>
This is allowed in SML/NJ because A and B have the same signature, even
though the sharing constraint is equivalent to
<pre>
  sharing type A.t = B.t
</pre>
and A.t and B.t have the rigid spec
<pre>
  type t = int.
</pre>

<h4>Note: Sharable Types</h4>
[Mostly for language lawyers]
<p>
There is some controversy about what type constructors should be
allowed in sharing constraints.  We can illustrate this by the
following example
<pre>
  signature S =
  sig
    type s
    type t = s
    type u
    sharing type t = u
  end
</pre>
By our definition above, <code>t</code> is defined, and therefore not sharable, and
this signature declaration is rejected.  Technically, however, the
semantic representation of <code>t</code> in the signature is the type function
<code>\().() <it>ns</it></code> (a nullary type function, where
<code><it>ns</it></code> is the semantic type
"name" for <code>s</code>), and this type function is eta-equivalent
to <code><it>ns</it></code>, a simple flexible type name.  Therefore,
if this eta-reduction is
assumed, <code>t</code> meets the requirements of the definition and can appear in
the sharing constraint.  On the other hand, consider
<pre>
  signature S =
  sig
    type s
    type t = s list
    type u
    sharing type t = u
  end
</pre>
Here the representation of <code>t</code> is the type function
<code>\().(()ns) list</code>,
which does not reduce to a simple type name, so the sharing constraint
is clearly illegal.

The reasons that we adopt the simpler and more restrictive meaning of
sharable are that it is easier to explain and it admits all sensible
usages.  I claim that it promotes a cleaner and simpler style in
signature writing.  It is also much simpler more efficient to
implement (at least for SML/NJ).

Here are some example signatures that are admitted under the
more complicated version of the definition (thanks to Martin Elsman):
<pre>
  signature S1 =
  sig
    type t
    type s = t
  end where type s = int

  signature S2 =
  sig
    type t
    type s = t
    sharing type t = s
  end

  signature S3 =
  sig
    type s
    structure U :
      sig
        type 'a t
        type u = (int * real) t
      end where type 'a t = s
  end where type U.u = int
</pre>
It is not clear that examples like these have any importance to anyone
other than language lawyers.  The last is particularly perverse: reading
a signature should not be an exercise in puzzle solving!

<h2>CM</h2>

<h3> User Level Changes </h3>
      
<ul>
 <li>
     assorted bugs fixed (e.g., <tt>CM.set_path</tt> is no longer a constant
      function, etc.)

 <p><li> CM now uses its own <em>archive</em> file format for storing
      <em>stable</em> groups.  To this end,  the
      contents of the binfiles are attached to the end of each stablefile
      and the header includes information about the
      corresponding positions.
      This means that after a group or library has been
      stabilized, one can safely remove
	  <ul>
	    <p><li> all source files
	    <p><li> all dependency files
	    <p><li> all binfiles
	  </ul>
      <p>
      Only the group description itself (one file) and the
      stablefile (one file per architecture/OS combination) must
      be present.

 <p><li> <em>argument types of CM interface functions:</em>
      All multi-argument functions now use _records_ (as opposed 
      to _tuples_).  This way there is less room for confusion
      because the arguments are named.

 <p><li> <em>result types of CM interface functions:</em>
      Boolean results now indicate whether or not CM had to
      recompile or re-link anything.
      Functions such as <tt>CM.make</tt>, <tt>CM.recompile</tt>, <tt>CMB.make</tt>, etc. 
      report a boolean result which will be true iff the
      function had to recompile or relink (re-execute) anything.

 <p><li> <em>Improved documentation:</em>
      The manual has been brought up-to-date.  This includes some 
      old ommisions, previously undocumented changes, and documentation
      of the current changes.

</ul>

<h3>  COMPILER NOTES</h3>
<ul>
    <li> <tt>CMB.make</tt> now builds a directory hierachy under
      hat is analogous to the hierarchy under
      <tt>src/compiler</tt>.  (There are some special hacks to make ".."
      work, though.)  This removes the need to keep all source
      file names distinct.
</ul>


<h3>  Bootstrap Internals </h3>

     <h4>A bit of History</h4>
       
	Originally, when you said <tt>CMB.make();</tt>, CM would compile the entire
	source tree and build compilers as well as interactive systems for all
	available architectures.   CM would then output "list" files in
	the <tt> bin.[arch]-[os]</tt> directory that omitted those sources that are
	not necessary for the current architecture.
       <p>
	But still, the name of the Compiler structure as well as the name of
	the structure representing the interactive system was
	architecture-specific.  Therefore, the boot process would select the
	bindings for those structures from the environment and re-bind them as
	"Compiler" etc.
	<p>
	Moreover, CM itself would be built as an "ordinary" SML program
	functorized by the "Compiler" structure.

     <h4> The New Organization</h4>
	Since sources of compiler and CM are merged, some things have already
	been streamlined.  I simplified things further in the following way:
        <ul>
	<p><li> <tt>CMB.make ();</tt> builds the compiler for the current architecture only.
	<p><li> Conditional compilation (via #if-directives in CM description files) 
	  is used to create a binding for structure Compiler directly without
	  hacking the environment during boot.
	<p><li> Both CM and the interactive loop refer to structure Compiler
	  (or relevant parts thereof -- see point 4 below) directly.
	  This way there only has to be one version of CM and one
	  interactive loop (i.e., one "glue").
	<p><li> Therefore, the boot process does not have to do any hacking to get
	  the right names bound.  (However, it still does some filtering of the
	  environment as it did before.)
	<p><li> <tt>CMB.retarget</tt> (the replacement of <tt>CMR.retarget</tt>) builds the desired
	  cross-compiler and makes two new structures available at top-level.
	  One of them is the cross-compiler version of CMB, the other the
	  cross-compiler version of the machine-dependent part of Compiler.
	  The original structures CMB and Compiler are retained.
	  Example for naming conventions:
<pre>
	    CMB.retarget { cpu = "sparc", os = "unix" };
</pre>
	  will create bindings for
<pre>
	    structure SparcUnixCMB     (* cross-compiler version of CMB *)
</pre>
	  and
<pre>
	    structure SparcVisComp     (* cross-compiler version of
					  the machine-dependent part of
					  Compiler *)
</pre>

  <h3> Visible Compiler Internals</h3>

          The <tt>Compiler</tt> structure is split into two parts:
           <ul>
	    <p><li> a machine-independent part called <tt>GenericVC</tt>
	    <p><li> a machine-dependent part called <tt>MachDepVC</tt>
	   </ul>
          <p>
	  These two structures are later merged again to form the
	  familiar Compiler structure.  The advantage, however, is on
	  CM's side:  much of the excessive  
	  functorization was untangled  because CM does not need to be abstracted 
	  over the "generic" part of the visible compiler.  This part
	  contains virtually all the relevant types which enables the 
	  elimination of  almost all "sharing" constraints from CM's source
	  code.

          <p>
	  To our pleasant surprise  this change has reduced
	  the size of the heap image by a few 100kB.
	  <p>
	  The main motivation, however, was to clean up CM's source code.
	  It may also make compilation of the compiler somewhat faster,
	  because CM is less heavy on functors now.  (This effect
	  doesn't seem to be very noticeable, though.)
<hr>
<h2> Basis</h2>
  <ul>
  <p><li> The <tt>in_pos</tt> type and the functions  <tt>getPosIn</tt> and  <tt>setPosIn</tt> are no
    longer part of the  <tt>STREAM_IO</tt> signature in the SML'97 basis, and
    have been removed from our implementation.  Likewise, the functions
     <tt>getPosIn</tt> and  <tt>setPosIn</tt> in the  <tt>IMPERATIVE_IO</tt> signature have been
    removed.  The function  <tt>filePosIn</tt> in  <tt>STREAM_IO</tt> now takes an instream
    argument (instead of a  <tt>in_pos</tt>).

  <p><li> The type of the mkInstream function in  <tt>STREAM_IO</tt> was fixed to agree
    with the SML'97 basis specification.

  <p><li> The types of  <tt>OS.Path.{mkRelative,mkAbsolute}</tt> were changed to track
    changes in the SML'97 basis specification.
  </ul>

<hr>
<h2>MLRISC</h2>
  o The  <tt>MLTREECOMP</tt> interface was extended to allow the injection
    of native instructions into the flowgraph being created. This
    is necessary on the sparc in order to insert  <tt>SAVE</tt> and  <tt>RESTORE</tt>
    instructions.

  o Insert  <tt>NOPS</tt> where required after floating point comparisions
    for older SPARC machines.

  o The  <tt>FLOWGRAPH</tt> interface has been removed from several modules
    that did not need it. 

  o  <tt>FCMP</tt>,  <tt>FTEST</tt>,  <tt>FBCC</tt> on the HPPA has been replaced by a composite
    FBRANCH instruction. This makes scheduling and
    other tasks easier.  Also, added BLR and BL in the instruction 
    set.

  o Fixed various assembly output bugs for the SPARC.

  o Not directly MLRISC related, but gc invocation points for known
    functions were marked as module entry points. This added an 
    unnecessary edge in the flowgraph.
