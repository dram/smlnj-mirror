    <h1>SML/NJ Installation Notes</h1>

<blockquote>
<h2>For Windows XP/Vista/7:</h2>
<p>
The easiest way to install SML/NJ on Windows machines is to use the 
self-installing executable: 
</p>
<a href="../dist/working/110.78/smlnj.msi"><strong>smlnj.msi</strong></a>.
<ol>
<li> Login as administrator (the setup must define system environment variables).
<li> Launch the self-installing executable.
<li> Follow the provided instructions.
</ol>
<p>
After running the Windows installer, you can find the compiler under
the Start menu in Windows 7 or earlier or Windows 10, as a program named "SML of New
Jersey".  In Windows 8 or 8.1, you will find it listed alphabetically
as "SML of New Jersey" in the "Apps by name" window (in the tiles
interface (formerly known as "Metro"), move your mouse under the lower-left corner of the left
block of tiles until a circle with a down arrow appears, then click
this circle to get to the Apps page).
</p>
<p>
Instructions for manually compiling SML/NJ on Windows using Visual C++
will be provided in an update of this page [dbm].
</p>
<!-- update these instructions
<p>
The installation updates the system PATH environment variable to point to the
location of the SML/NJ executables, and adds a CM_PATH environment
variable to point to the location of the libraries.  Because of these
updates, it is necessary to reboot the machine after the installation
to ensure proper behavior of the compiler.
<p>

To recompile the runtime system, the SML/NJ compiler itself, or
any of the tools, you will need to refer to the <a
href="windows.html">manual installation instructions for Windows</a>.

<!-- Need to build Linux packages (RPM, port, etc.)
<h2>Linux RPM Installation:</h2>

Administrators of Intel-based Linux systems can use the
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/rpm/">RedHat package manager "RPM"</a>
to install SML/NJ.  This has been tested on an installation of RedHat
6.1-2 and 7.0.  Use the distribution file:
<blockquote>
<a href="../dist/release/110.0.7/smlnj-110.0.7-4.i386.rpm">
smlnj-110.0.7-4.i386.rpm</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
Should you have difficulties with the RPM installation, or wish to
customize the installation, then we recommend falling back on the
following generic installation procedure for Unix.
-->

<h2>For Unix machines:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create an SMLROOT directory for the installation (e.g.,
SMLROOT=/usr/local/sml) in a place where it is appropriate to install
software packages.  On some machines administrator privileges may be required to
create the new sml directory in a public directory like /usr/local or
/opt, but if necessary you can always install sml in a subdirectory of
your own home directory.
</li>
<li>Download the
  <a href="../dist/working/110.78/config.tgz">config.tgz</a>
tarball and unpack it in the $SMLROOT directory using the command
<pre>
$ tar xzvf config.tgz
</pre>
</li>
<li>
[<em>Optional</em>] If you wish to customize the installation to include more or
fewer components than the default, edit the file config/targets,
commenting out any targets that you do not want to install or removing
comment characters from components that you want to add.  However,
editing config/targets is not required or recommended for first-time
users.
</li>
<li>
Execute the shell command:
<pre>
$ config/install.sh
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
The <tt>install.sh</tt> command will download the necessary sources
and binaries for the current architecture and operating system, unpack
them, compile the runtime system, build the sml compiler
(<tt>bin/sml</tt>) and compile the SML/NJ libraries and tools.
These are installed in the subdirectories <tt>bin</tt> and
<tt>lib</tt> of $SMLROOT.
<p>
If you have multiple hardware/operating system platforms sharing the
same file system, you can run <tt>config/install.sh</tt>
on each platform. The various architecture/os specific versions of
the executables and libraries can coexist in the same $SMLROOT directory.

The installation process creates the following subdirectories in
the installation directory:
<table>
<tr><td>config <td>- the configuration tools
<tr><td>bin <td>- shell scripts for running sml and the tools
<tr><td>bin/.run <td>- contains the runtime systems
<tr><td>bin/.heap <td>- contains the heap images
<tr><td>lib <td>- compilation-manager sources files for the various libraries
<tr><td>src <td>- the source code; installing libraries also leaves
			  the precompiled library code in this subtree.
</table>

<h2>TROUBLESHOOTING</h2>
<p>
The most likely problems arise while compiling the runtime system. You may
need to edit the architecture/operating system specific makefile. You
can find these files in the directory 
<tt>SMLROOT/src/runtime/objs</tt>. They
are named mk.<arch>-<opsys> (e.g., mk.x86-unix, mk.ppc-unix).
They are currently set up to use the gcc on Unix systems (including
Mac OS X and Linux) and Visual C++ on Windows.
<p>
If you are installing on <strong>64-bit Linux</strong> systems,
you may have to install 32-bit compatibility libraries in order to
compile the runtime system, which is 32-bit code. Some 64-bit Linux
systems are not configured with 32-bit support by default. In such a case, you may get
the message
<pre>
	!!! SML/NJ requires support for 32-bit executables
</pre>
when running <tt>config/install.sh</tt>. To fix this problem, you will need
to acquire the 32-bit emulation libraries for your particular Linux
distribution.

For Debian and Ubuntu, you will need two packages: <tt>gcc-multilib</tt>, 
and <tt>ia32-libs</tt>. These can be installed using apt-get:
<pre>
      apt-get install gcc-multilib ia32-libs
</pre>
For Red Hat Fedora (e.g. Fedora 16), you will need to install
glibc-devel(i686):
<pre>
      yum install glibc-devel.i686
</pre>
For Red Hat Enterprise Linux (or CentOS) 6.2, you may also have to
install the rpm package libgcc-multilib, e.g.:
<pre>
      rpm -ivh libgcc-multilib-4.4.2-5.x86_64.rpm
</pre>
where the <tt>libgcc-multilib</tt> package can be downloaded from the
rpmseek web site (yum does not appear to know about this package).
