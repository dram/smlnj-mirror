    <h1>SML/NJ Installation Notes</h1>

<blockquote>
<h2>For Windows 9X and Windows NT (3.5.1 and above) and Windows 2000:</h2>
<p>
The easiest way to install SML/NJ on Windows machines is to use the 
self-installing executable <strong>smlnj.exe</strong> (
<a href="../dist/release/110.0.7/smlnj.exe">http</a>)

<ol>
<li> Login as administrator (the setup must define system environment variables).
<li> Launch the self-installing executable.
<li> Choose a destination folder for SML/NJ (default C:\SML).
<li> Choose a setup. Choices include:
  <ul>
  <li> typical: installs the runtime system, the compiler (including the
  compilation manager), ml-lex, ml-yacc, ml-burg and most components
  of the SML/NJ library.
  <li> compact: installs only the runtime system and the compiler.
  <li> custom: allows you to choose the components to install.
  </ul>
<li> Choose a folder that will contain the program icons for
SML/NJ. This folder will be part of the Programs folder of the
Start menu.
</ol>

The installation updates the system PATH environment variable to point to the
location of the SML/NJ executables, and adds a CM_PATH environment
variable to point to the location of the libraries.  Because of these
updates, it is necessary to reboot the machine after the installation
to ensure proper behavior of the compiler (Windows NT/2000 users can logoff
instead of rebooting).<p>

To recompile the runtime system, the SML/NJ compiler itself, or
any of the tools, you will need to refer to the <a
href="windows.html">manual installation instructions for Windows</a>.

<h2>Linux RPM Installation:</h2>

Administrators of Intel-based Linux systems can use the
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/rpm/">RedHat package manager "RPM"</a>
to install SML/NJ.  This has been tested on an installation of RedHat
6.1-2 and 7.0.  Use the distribution file:
<blockquote>
<a href="../dist/release/110.0.7/smlnj-110.0.7-4.i386.rpm">
smlnj-110.0.7-4.i386.rpm</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
Should you have difficulties with the RPM installation, or wish to
customize the installation, then we recommend falling back on the
following generic installation procedure for Unix.

<h2>For Unix machines:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create an SMLROOT directory for the installation (e.g.,
SMLROOT=/usr/local/sml) in a place where it is appropriate to install
software packages.  On some machines administrator privileges may be required to
create the new sml directory in a public directory like /usr/local or
/opt, but if necessary you can always install sml in a subdirectory of
your own home directory.
<p>
<li>Download the compressed tar files that make up the distribution into this
SMLROOT directory.  These files will be unpacked automatically
by the install script (except for config.tar.Z; see step 3).
<p>
You will need at least the following source packages from the distribution:
<p>
<table>
<tr><td><td>config.tar.Z
<td><a href="../dist/release/110.0.7/config.tar.Z">http</a>
<td>Installation scripts
<tr><td><td>runtime.tar.Z
<td><a href="../dist/release/110.0.7/runtime.tar.Z">http</a>
<td>Runtime system
<tr><td><td> cm.tar.Z
<td><a href="../dist/release/110.0.7/cm.tar.Z">http</a>
<td>Compilation Manager
</table>
<p>
In addition to the tar files for the various sources,
you also need the pre-compiled binary files for the compiler.
You will need <strong>one</strong> of these files:
<p>
<table>
<tr><td><td> bin.alpha32-unix.tar.Z
<td><a href="../dist/release/110.0.7/bin.alpha32-unix.tar.Z">http</a>
<td>for DEC Alpha and Digital Unix 4.0
<tr><td><td> bin.hppa-unix.tar.Z
<td><a href="../dist/release/110.0.7/cm.tar.Z">http</a>
<td>for HPPA processors
<tr><td><td> bin.mipseb-unix.tar.Z
<td><a href="../dist/release/110.0.7/bin.mipseb-unix.tar.Z">http</a>
<td>for Silicon Graphics machines
<tr><td><td> bin.rs6000-unix.tar.Z
<td><a href="../dist/release/110.0.7/bin.rs6000-unix.tar.Z">http</a>
<td>for IBM Power processors
<tr><td><td> bin.sparc-unix.tar.Z
<td><a href="../dist/release/110.0.7/bin.sparc-unix.tar.Z">http</a>
<td>for SPARC processors
<tr><td><td> bin.x86-unix.tar.Z
<td><a href="../dist/release/110.0.7/bin.x86-unix.tar.Z">http</a>
<td>for Intel Pentium processors running UNIX.
</table>
<p>
If your file system is mounted on multiple machines with different
instruction sets, you may fetch more than one of these "bin" files.
<p>
Finally, you may wish to fetch some of the following optional
components of the SML/NJ distribution (a "*" marks a member of the
standard <tt>config/targets</tt>, see below):
<p>
<table>
<tr><td>*<td> smlnj-lib.tar.Z
<td><a href="../dist/release/110.0.7/smlnj-lib.tar.Z">http</a>
<td>Standard ML of New Jersey Library
<tr><td>*<td> ml-burg.tar.Z
<td><a href="../dist/release/110.0.7/ml-burg.tar.Z">http</a>
<td>ML-Burg code-generator generator
<tr><td>*<td> ml-lex.tar.Z
<td><a href="../dist/release/110.0.7/ml-lex.tar.Z">http</a>
<td>ML-Lex lexical analyzer generator
<tr><td>*<td> ml-yacc.tar.Z
<td><a href="../dist/release/110.0.7/ml-yacc.tar.Z">http</a>
<td>ML-Yacc parser generator
<tr><td><td> sml-nj.tar.Z
<td><a href="../dist/release/110.0.7/sml-nj.tar.Z">http</a>
<td>Source code for SML/NJ compiler
<tr><td>*<td> cml.tar.Z
<td><a href="../dist/release/110.0.7/cml.tar.Z">http</a>
<td>Concurrent ML
<tr><td>*<td> eXene.tar.Z
<td><a href="../dist/release/110.0.7/eXene.tar.Z">http</a>
<td>eXene multithreaded X-windows toolkit
</table>

<p>
<li>Unpack the configuration bundle in the sml ROOT directory
<pre>
    % zcat config.tar.Z | tar -xf -
</pre>
This will create a subdirectory <tt>config</tt>.
<p>
<li> If you wish to customize the installation to include more or
fewer components than the default, edit the file config/targets,
commenting out any targets that you do not want to install or removing
comment characters from components that you want to add.  However,
you not need to edit the targets file; if you leave it alone
the subsystems marked with an asterisk * above will be installed by default.
Editing config/targets is not required or recommended for first-time
users.
<p>
<li>Run the installation script while in the SMLROOT directory:
<pre>
    % config/install.sh
</pre>
<p>
<li>If you have multiple hardware/operating system platforms sharing the
same file system, you can run <tt>config/install.sh</tt>
on each platform.
</ol>

The installation process creates the following subdirectories in
the installation directory:

<table>
<tr><td>config <td>- the configuration tools
<tr><td>bin <td>- shell scripts for running sml and the tools
<tr><td>bin/.run <td>- contains the runtime systems
<tr><td>bin/.heap <td>- contains the heap images
<tr><td>lib <td>- compilation-manager sources files for the various libraries
<tr><td>src <td>- the source code; installing libraries also leaves
			  the precompiled library code in this subtree.
</table>

<h2>POTENTIAL PROBLEMS</h2>
<p>
The most likely problem is in compiling the runtime system.  You may
need to edit the architecture/operating system specific makefile.  You
can find these files in the directory 
<tt>SMLROOT/src/runtime/objs</tt>.  They
are named mk.<arch>-<opsys> (e.g., mk.sparc-sunos, mk.mipseb-irix5).
They are currently set up to use the vendor compiler on the mips, and
alpha, and to use gcc on the sparc, rs6000 and x86.
<p>
The install shell script checks to see if your system has Korn shell
(ksh); if so, it uses that for the shell in the shell scripts (ksh is
faster than /bin/sh).  If you are installing your system on multiple
platforms, where some have ksh and some do not, then install the
system on a platform that does not have ksh first.
