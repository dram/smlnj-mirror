SML/NJ Manual Installation for Windows 9X/NT
</h1>
<blockquote>
These instructions are provided for those who need to install a
version of SML/NJ that does not include an installer program (i.e. a
self-installing .exe), or who need to recompile the
runtime system, the SML/NJ compiler, or other tools provided with
the SML/NJ distribution.
<p>
<blockquote>
NOTE: These instructions apply to Windows NT and Windows 2000.  The build
process will not currently work under Windows 9X because of
differences in the syntax accepted by the MSDOS command prompt.
</blockquote>

<h2>Required tools</h2>
<p>
To unpack the distribution, you will need the Windows versions of the
"GNU unzip" (<tt>gunzip</tt>) and "tape archive" (<tt>tar</tt>)
utilities. These are freely available from <a
href="ftp://ftp.cs.washington.edu/pub/ntemacs/utilities">
ftp.cs.washington.edu:/pub/ntemacs/utilities</a>.  They are also
included in common Unix-on-Windows systems like MKS Toolkit and
UWIN.
<p>
Running the windows install.sh script or building manually requires a
Unix shell (<em>ksh</em> preferred) and other common Unix tools
(<tt>sed</tt>, <tt>grep</tt>). We use MKS Toolkit to provide these
facilites, although other <em>ksh</em> based toolkits should work
directly as well; e.g. <a
href="http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/uwin/">UWIN</a>.
<p>
Compiling the runtime system requires the following tools:
<ul>
<li>MS Visual C++, 2.0 or later  (we used 6.0)
<li>MS Assembler (MASM), 6.11 or later
<li>MS NMAKE (part of VC++), 1.50 or later
</ul>
<p>
It should not be difficult to adapt the source code to build with
other compilers, assemblers, and "make" utilities (see
<tt>src\runtime\objs\makefile.win32</tt> and
<tt>src\runtime\objs\mk.x86-win32</tt>).<p>

<h2>Installing using configwin/install.sh</h2>
<p>
Fetch the tarball windows.tar.Z from [location to be determined].
<p>
This package contains a configwin directory with a modified install.sh
script for building the compiler.  You will also need the files
<table>
<tr><td><td> runtime.tar.Z
<td><a href="../dist/runtime.tar.Z">http</a>
<tr><td><td> bin.x86-win32.tar.Z
<td><a href="../dist/bin.x86-win32.tar.Z">http</a>
<tr><td><td> smlnj-lib.tar.Z
<td><a href="../dist/smlnj-lib.tar.Z">http</a>
<tr><td><td> ml-lex.tar.Z
<td><a href="../dist/ml-lex.tar.Z">http</a> 
<tr><td><td> ml-yacc.tar.Z
<td><a href="../dist/ml-yacc.tar.Z">http</a>
<tr><td><td> ml-burg.tar.Z
<td><a href="../dist/ml-burg.tar.Z">http</a>
<tr><td><td> cml.tar.Z
<td><a href="../dist/cml.tar.Z">http</a>
</table>
<p>
Unpack the windows.tar.Z package by running
<pre>
    zcat windows.tar.Z | tar xvf -
</pre>
This will produce a directory named "windows" containing
subdirectories <em>doc</em>, <em>configwin</em>, and <em>is-gen</em>.
Move the configwin directory in which you want to install SML,
along with the tarballs listed above.  Then from a Unix shell, run
configwin/install.sh.
<p>
The windows/doc directory contains detailed instructions for building
and installing SML/NJ manually (doc/WIN32-BUILD).  The is-gen
directory contains code for a utility that is used to build an
InstallShield project from the installation created by
configwin/install.sh.
