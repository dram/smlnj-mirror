<h3>SML/NJ web site now mirrored at SourceForge</h3>
</a>
           
<blockquote>
<a name="SF-mirror">The master copy of the SML/NJ web pages is now
kept in the CVS repository of the smlnj SourceForge project (see
</a> <a href="#sourceforge">previous item on SourceForge
projects</a>).
The <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj">
Bell-Labs-hosted site</a> is now joined by <a
href="http://www.smlnj.org/">www.smlnj.org</a>, which mirrors the
same pages from the repository.

<h3>Working version 110.33 supports Mac OS X and experimentat FFI</h3>
</a>

<blockquote>
<a name="macosx">The recently released</a>
<a href="NEWS/110.33-README.html">110.33</a>
working version runs under Mac OS X.  It also introduces
Matthias Blume's new, experimental FFI, NLFFI ("No-Longer Foreign Function
Interface").    Currently NLFFI is available only under x86-linux, but it
is being ported to other architectures.

<h3>New 110.0.7 smlnj.exe works on Windows 9X</h3>
</a>

<blockquote>
<a name="smlnj.exe">The original version of the Windows installer,
smlnj.exe, for 110.0.7 had a problem when running under Windows 95/98/ME
that caused error messages abound undefined strings like PRODUCT_NAME.  This
problem has been corrected in a new</a>
<a href="ftp://ftp.research.bell-labs.com/dist/smlnj/release/110/smlnj.exe">
smlnj.exe</a>
now available in the usual 110.0.7
<a href="ftp://ftp.research.bell-labs.com/dist/smlnj/release/110/">ftp</a> and
<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj/dist">http</a>
distribution directories.                                 
    
<p>This new smlnj.exe (as of 23 March 01) also corrects a problem
where installation only set the user PATH and CM_PATH environment
variables.  Now the installer sets these variables at the system level
for all users.  Installation must be done from an administrator
account.</p>

<h3>New Standard ML and SML/NJ SourceForge projects</h3>
</a>
                                         
<blockquote>
<a name="sourceforge">Two new SML-related projects have been started
at SourceForge, a site and organization supporting collaborative
development of open-source software.  The</a>
<a href="http://www.standardml.org/">Standard ML (sml)</a>
project at <a href="http://www.standardml.org/">www.standardml.org</a>
supports all Standard ML implementations by encouraging sharing of
resources such as test suites, benchmarks, libraries, and
documentaion.  The <a href="http://www.smlnj.org/">Standard ML of New
Jersey (smlnj)</a> project at
<a href="http://www.smlnj.org/">www.smlnj.org</a>
is intended to be the future home of SML/NJ
(including web pages, releases, CVS repository, etc.).

<h3>Patch Release 110.0.7</h3>
</a>                                                              
   
<blockquote>
A new minor release version
<a href="NEWS/110-README.html">110.0.7</a>
is now available.  This is the sixth patch release for
version 110 (110.0.4 was not released).  This patch release fixes a
long-standing bug in signal handling.  It also includes a number of
SML/NJ Library enhancements and fixes and some fixes to CM and eXene,
and a small number of other bug fixes.  See the
<a href="NEWS/110-PATCH-HISTORY"> 110-PATCH-HISTORY</a> file for
details. With this release, we are also making the distribution files
available for download via http as well as ftp.  See the
<a href="dist/110.0.7.html"> 110.0.7 distribution page</a>.
[<strong>Note:</strong> The original smlnj.exe installer for
Windows had incorrect CM tool paths.  This has been corrected by a new
smlnj.exe as of October 18, 2000.]

<a name="Version-111">                                           
<h3>Plans for the next release (Version 111)</h3>
</a>                                                              
             
<blockquote>

Meanwhile, work continues on the next release, 
which we hope to have ready for a beta release "real soon now". The next 
release will not contain any major language or Basis library changes, but 
there will be major internal changes, including:                        

<ul>
<li>A new runtime system with improved management of virtual memory.</li>
<li>New support for foreign functions (C) based on IDL.</li>
<li>Conformance with the soon to be published SML Basis spec.</li>
<li>MLRISC code generators for all architectures.</li>
<li>The FLINT representation has partially replaced the old cps
representation in the back end.</li>
</ul>

In addition, there will be a couple significant language extensions:
lazy datatypes and lazy functions over such datatypes, functional
record concatenation (a "with" operation), and mutable records whose
fields can be updated.
                         
<p>Most features of Version 111 are implemented in current working
versions.  The main missing elements are the new runtime system and a
MIPS code generator.</p>

<h3>Working Versions</h3>
</a>
                                                                        
<blockquote>

<a name="110.46">The latest working version</a> (<a
href="NEWS/110.46-README.html">110.46</a>) is another step to spec
compliance for the Basis Library. It also fixes a number of bugs and
improves the win32 port by adding some previously missing
functionality to the runtime system.
<a name="110.45">Earlier</a>, <a href="NEWS/110.45-README.html">110.45</a>
fixed some installation problems caused by incompatibilities with GCC
3.3.  <a name ="110.44">Before that,</a> <a
href="NEWS/110.44-README.html">110.44</a> brought our implementation
of the Basis library closer to the specification, fixed several
important bugs, and provided support for Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther).  <a
name="110.43">The previous working release</a> (<a
href="NEWS/110.43-README.html">110.43</a>) offered an operational
win32 port, added IntInf support to compiler and Basis library, and
also updated many interfaces of the Basis according to the latest
draft of the specification.  <a name="110.42">Earlier,</a> <a
href="NEWS/110.42-README.html">110.42</a> resolved a problem with a
CML memory leak supported MacOS X 10.2 (Jaguar).  The <a
name="110.41">previous update</a> (<a
href="NEWS/110.41-README.html">110.41</a>) fixed--along with some
other bugs--a long-standing memory leakage problem in the garbage
collector.  However, the volume of changes paled in comparison to its
predecessor version <a name="110.40"><a
href="NEWS/110.40-README.html">110.40</a>, which came with many
bugfixes and improvements to libraries and has seen much work in the
MLRISC backend.  There were also numerous updates to many other parts
of the system.  110.40 succeeded a mostly-bugfix release (<a
href="NEWS/110.39-README.html">110.39</a>) and built on <a
href="NEWS/110.38-README.html">110.38</a> which provided internal
improvements to MLRISC and overhauled the FFI. The version before that
(<a href="NEWS/110.37-README.html">110.37</a>) came with some
enhancements to CM and more improvements to the MLRISC backend. All
working releases since <a href="NEWS/110.35-README">110.35</a> are
based on a new organization of compiler source code into CM libraries,
run under the new Mac OS X, include Matthias Blume's new, experimental
FFI (NLFFI) for x86-linux (and now sparc) and support CML as well as
eXene.

<p>Since working version 110.9.1, major internal changes have been
implemented and many changes are still in progress.  Version <a
href="NEWS/110.12-README">110.12</a> introduced fundamental changes in
array, vector and string representations and a new garbage collector
interface.  Extensive changes have also been made to the ML-RISC code
generators.</p>
                                                                        
                          
<p>Starting with <a href="NEWS/110.20-README.html">110.20</a>, a major
overhaul of the CM compilation manager has been in progress,
accompanied with a reorganization of the compiler itself into a set of
libraries.</p>
                                                                        
                          
<p>The next working release will incorporate an updated version of the
FLINT middle end.  At this point, we will change the way the code is
managed by having a publically accessible CVS repository at Yale.</p>
                                                                        
                          
<p>As usual, use the working versions at your own risk. 
Some working versions incorporate substantial changes that reduce stability 
and introduce bugs.</p>
