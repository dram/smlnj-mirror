     110.33</a> working version runs under Mac OS X.  It also introduces
Matthias   Blume's new, experimental FFI, NLFFI ("No-Longer Foreign Function
Interface").    Currently NLFFI is available only under x86-linux, but it
is being ported   to other architectures. </blockquote>

    <blockquote> <a name="smlnj.exe">The original version of the Windows installer,
smlnj.exe, for 110.0.7 had a problem when running under Windows 95/98/ME
that caused error messages abound undefined strings like PRODUCT_NAME.  This
problem has been corrected in a new  </a><a href="ftp://ftp.research.bell-labs.com/dist/smlnj/release/110/smlnj.exe">
     smlnj.exe</a> now available in the usual 110.0.7 <a href="ftp://ftp.research.bell-labs.com/dist/smlnj/release/110/">

      <p> This new smlnj.exe (as of 23 March 01) also corrects a problem where
installation only set the user PATH and CM_PATH environment variables.  Now
the installer sets these variables at the system level for all users.  Installation
must be done from an administrator account. </p>

              <blockquote> Meanwhile, work continues on the next release, 
  which we hope to have ready for a beta release "real soon now". The next 
 release will not contain any major language or Basis library changes, but 
 there will be major internal changes, including:                        
                                                             
                <ul>
      <li>A new runtime system with improved management of virtual memory.
                   </li>
                       <li>New support for foreign functions (C) based on 
IDL.                     </li>
                       <li>Conformance with the soon to be published SML
Basis   spec. </li>
                       <li>MLRISC code generators for all architectures.
                  </li>
                       <li>The FLINT representation has partially replaced
 the  old cps representation in the back end. </li>
                                                                         
               
                </ul>
      In addition, there will be a couple significant language extensions:
 lazy  datatypes and lazy functions over such datatypes, functional record
 concatenation  (a "with" operation), and mutable records whose fields can
 be updated.                                                            
                         
                <p> Most features of Version 111 are implemented in current 
  working versions.  The main missing elements are the new runtime system 
and  a MIPS code generator. </p>
