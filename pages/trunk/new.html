<H3>SML/NJ web site now mirrored at SourceForge</H3>
<blockquote>
The master copy of the SML/NJ web pages is now kept in the CVS
repository of the smlnj SourceForge project (see <a
href="#sourceforge">previous item on SourceForge projects</a>).  The
<a href="http:/cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj">Bell-Labs-hosted
site</a> is now joined by
<a href="http://www.smlnj.org">www.smlnj.org</a>,
which mirrors the same pages from the repository.

<A name="macosx">
<H3>Working version 110.33 supports Mac OS X and experimentat FFI</H3>
<blockquote>
The recently released 
<A HREF="NEWS/110.33-README.html">110.33</A>
working version runs under Mac OS X.  It also introduces Matthias Blume's new,
experimental FFI, NLFFI ("No-Longer Foreign Function Interface").
Currently NLFFI is available only under x86-linux, but it is being
ported to other architectures.

<A name="smlnj.exe">
<H3>New 110.0.7 smlnj.exe works on Windows 9X</H3>
<blockquote>
The original version of the Windows installer, smlnj.exe, for 110.0.7
had a problem when running under Windows 95/98/ME that caused error messages
abound undefined strings like PRODUCT_NAME.  This problem has been
corrected in a new 
<a href="ftp://ftp.research.bell-labs.com/dist/smlnj/release/110/smlnj.exe">smlnj.exe</a>
now available in the usual 110.0.7
<a href="ftp://ftp.research.bell-labs.com/dist/smlnj/release/110/">
ftp</a> and 
<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj/dist">http</a>
distribution directories.  
<p>
This new smlnj.exe (as of 23 March 01) also corrects a problem where
installation only set the user PATH and CM_PATH environment variables.
Now the installer sets these variables at the system level for all
users.  Installation must be done from an administrator account.

<A name="sourceforge">
<H3>New Standard ML and SML/NJ SourceForge projects</H3>
<blockquote>
Two new SML-related projects have been started at SourceForge, a site
and organization supporting collaborative development of open-source
software.  The 
<A href="http://www.standardml.org">Standard ML (sml)</A> project at
<A HREF="http://www.standardml.org">www.standardml.org</A> supports
all Standard ML implementations by encouraging sharing of resources
such as test suites, benchmarks, libraries, and documentaion.  The
<A href="http://www.smlnj.org">Standard ML of New Jersey (smlnj)</A>
project at <A HREF="http://www.smlnj.org">www.smlnj.org</A>
is intended to be the future home of SML/NJ (including web
pages, releases, CVS repository, etc.).

<H3>New SML/NJ tutorial by Riccardo Pucella</H3>
<blockquote>
<A HREF="mailto:riccardo@cs.cornell.edu">Riccardo Pucella</a> has
written an extensive new tutorial,
<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/riccardo/smlnj.html"> <strong>Notes on
Programming SML/NJ</strong></a>, which is available as <A
HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/riccardo/prog-smlnj/notes-011001.ps">postscript</A>
or <A
HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/riccardo/prog-smlnj/notes-011001.pdf">PDF</A>.
This is a first draft of the Notes, and Riccardo welcomes corrections
and suggestions.

<A name="sml-mode">
<H3>New version of sml-mode added to contrib/emacs</H3>
<blockquote>
<A HREF="mailto:monnier@cs.yale.edu">Stefan Monnier's</a> latest
version, 3.9.5, of the sml-mode package for emacs has been added to the
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.research.bell-labs.com/dist/smlnj/contrib/emacs">contrib/emacs</A>
directory.
</blockquote>

<A name="110.0.7">
<H3>Patch Release 110.0.7</H3> </A>
<blockquote>
A new minor release version <a href="NEWS/110-README.html">110.0.7</a>
is now available.  This is the sixth patch release for version 110
(110.0.4 was not released).  This patch release fixes a long-standing
bug in signal handling.  It also includes a number of SML/NJ Library
enhancements and fixes and some fixes to CM and eXene, and a small
number of other bug fixes.  See the
<a href="NEWS/110-PATCH-HISTORY">110-PATCH-HISTORY</a> file for
      details.
With this release, we are also making the distribution files available
for download via http as well as ftp.  See the
<a href="dist/110.0.7.html">110.0.7 distribution page</a>.
[<strong>Note:</strong> The original smlnj.exe installer for Windows
had incorrect CM tool paths.  This has been corrected by a new
smlnj.exe as of October 18, 2000.]

<A name="Version-111">
<H3>Plans for the next release (Version 111)</H3> </A>
<blockquote>
Meanwhile, work
continues on the next release, which we hope to have ready for a
beta release "real soon now".
The next release will not contain any major language
or Basis library changes, but there will be major internal changes,
including:
<UL>
<LI>A new runtime system with improved management of virtual memory.
<LI>New support for foreign functions (C) based on IDL.
<LI>Conformance with the soon to be published SML Basis spec.
<LI>MLRISC code generators for all architectures.
<LI>The FLINT representation has partially replaced the old cps
representation in the back end.
</UL>
In addition, there will be a couple significant language extensions:
lazy datatypes and lazy functions over such datatypes, functional
record concatenation (a "with" operation), and mutable records whose
fields can be updated.
<p> Most features of Version 111 are implemented in current working
versions.  The main missing elements are the new runtime system and
a MIPS code generator.

<H3><A HREF="software.html#SOFTWARE:WORKING-VERSIONS">Working Versions</A></H3>
<P>
<blockquote>
<A name="110.36">
The latest working version is <A HREF="NEWS/110.36-README.html">110.36</A>.
It fixes a few important bugs.  Like <A HREF="NEWS/110.35-README">110.35</A>,
it is based on a new organization of compiler source code into CM libraries,
runs under the new Mac OS X, includes Matthias Blume's new, experimental FFI
(NLFFI) for x86-linux and supports CML as well as eXene.
<p>
Since working version 110.9.1, major internal changes have been
implemented and many changes are still in progress.  Version
<A HREF="NEWS/110.12-README">110.12</A> introduced fundamental
changes in array, vector and string representations and a new garbage
collector interface.  Extensive changes have also been made to the
ML-RISC code generators.
<p> Starting with <A HREF="NEWS/110.20-README.html">110.20</A>, a
major overhaul of the CM compilation manager has been in progress,
accompanied with a reorganization of the compiler itself into a set
of libraries.
<p>
The next working release will incorporate an updated version of the
FLINT middle end.  At this point, we will change the way the code is
managed by having a publically accessible CVS repository at Yale.
<p>
As usual, use the working versions at your own risk.  Some working
versions incorporate substantial changes that reduce stability and
introduce bugs.
