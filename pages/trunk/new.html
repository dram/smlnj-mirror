<h3>SML/NJ web site now hosted at the University of Chicago</h3>
</a>
           
<blockquote>
<a name="SF-mirror">The master copy of the SML/NJ web pages is now
kept in the svn repository of the smlnj gforge project at the
university of Chicago (svn://smlnj-gforge.uchicago.edu/smlnj/pages).
<p>
The web pages are mirrored at the SML/NJ sourceforge project
<href="http://smlnj.sourceforge.net/">smlnj.sourceforge.net</a>,
which should mirror the same pages from the repository. [There may
be some lag however, because the smlnj-gforge svn repository cannot
be checked out at the sourceforge server and the pages have to be
updated manually.]
<p>
System source code, libraries, utilities, benchmarks, and test suites
are also now hosted primarily in the smlnj-gforge.uchicago.edu
repository.

<h3>New Standard ML and SML/NJ SourceForge projects</h3>
</a>
                                         
<blockquote>
<a name="sourceforge">Two new SML-related projects have been started
at SourceForge, a site and organization supporting collaborative
development of open-source software.  The</a>
<a href="http://www.standardml.org/">Standard ML (sml)</a>
project at <a href="http://www.standardml.org/">www.standardml.org</a>
supports all Standard ML implementations by encouraging sharing of
resources such as test suites, benchmarks, libraries, and
documentaion.  The <a href="http://www.smlnj.org/">Standard ML of New
Jersey (smlnj)</a> project at
<a href="http://www.smlnj.org/">www.smlnj.org</a>
is intended to be the future home of SML/NJ
(including web pages, releases, CVS repository, etc.).

<h3>Working Versions</h3>
</a>
                                                                        
<blockquote>

<a name="110.60">The latest working version</a>
(<a href="dist/working/110.60/110.60-README.html">110.60</a>) fixes a
signal-handling problem on Intel-based Macs and comes with two new
program-generator tools (<tt>ml-ulex</tt> and <tt>ml-antlr</tt>).  It
also brings MLRISC-support for AMD64 and uses a new directory layout.
Beginning with 110.60, the master source repository
uses <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">subversion</a> and is no
longer hosted by SourceForge.
<a name="110.59">The previous working version</a>
(<a href="dist/working/110.59/110.59-README.html">110.59</a>) provided
bugfixes and minor improvements, following the
<a name="110.58">previous version</a>
(<a href="dist/working/110.58/110.58-README.html">110.58</a>) which added
support for Intel-based Macs as well as x86-64-based Linux machines and
came with <b>lexgen</b>, a brand-new drop-in replacement
for <tt>ml-lex</tt>.
<a name="110.57">The version before that</a> (<a
href="dist/working/110.57/110.57-README.html">110.57</a>), much like
its predecessors
 <a name="110.56"><a href="dist/working/110.56/110.56-README.html">110.56</a></a>,
 <a name="110.55"><a href="dist/working/110.55/110.55-README.html">110.55</a></a>,
 <a name="110.54"><a href="dist/working/110.54/110.54-README.html">110.54</a></a>,
 <a name="110.53"><a href="dist/working/110.53/110.53-README.html">110.53</a></a> and
 <a name="110.52"><a
href="dist/working/110.52/110.52-README.html">110.52</a></a>,
fixed various bugs and provided minor feature enhancements.  The
version before that,
<a href="dist/working/110.51/110.51-README.html">110.51</a>,
mostly consisted of the addition of an (inefficient)
implementation of 64-bit integer arithmetic to <i>its</i> <a
name="110.50">predecessor</a>.
<a href="dist/working/110.50/110.50-README.html">110.50</a>
provided bugfixes to NLFFI on x86, improved support for back-tracing,
added a simple test coverage tool and had minor improvements
to other parts of the system.
<a name="110.49">The earlier <a
href="dist/working/110.49/110.49-README.html">110.49</a></a> came <a
name="110.48">hot on the heels of</a> <a
href="dist/working/110.48/110.48-README.html">110.48</a>.
These two versions were bugfix
releases on <a href="dist/working/110.47/110.47-README.html">110.47</a>,
which featured a preliminary implementation of the NLFFI foreign
function
interface under Mac OS X and under Microsoft Windows.  (NLFFI was
previously available under x86/Linux and Sparc/Solaris only.)
The <a name="110.46">preceding version</a> (<a
href="NEWS/110.46-README.html">110.46</a>) was another step to spec
compliance for the Basis Library. It also fixed a number of bugs and
improved the win32 port by adding some previously missing
functionality to the runtime system.
<a name="110.45">Earlier</a>, <a href="NEWS/110.45-README.html">110.45</a>
fixed some installation problems caused by incompatibilities with GCC
3.3.  <a name ="110.44">Before that,</a> <a
href="NEWS/110.44-README.html">110.44</a> brought our implementation
of the Basis library closer to the specification, fixed several
important bugs, and provided support for Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther).  <a
name="110.43">The previous working release</a> (<a
href="NEWS/110.43-README.html">110.43</a>) offered an operational
win32 port, added IntInf support to compiler and Basis library, and
also updated many interfaces of the Basis according to the latest
draft of the specification.  <a name="110.42">Earlier,</a> <a
href="NEWS/110.42-README.html">110.42</a> resolved a problem with a
CML memory leak supported MacOS X 10.2 (Jaguar).  The <a
name="110.41">previous update</a> (<a
href="NEWS/110.41-README.html">110.41</a>) fixed--along with some
other bugs--a long-standing memory leakage problem in the garbage
collector.  However, the volume of changes paled in comparison to its
predecessor version <a name="110.40"><a
href="NEWS/110.40-README.html">110.40</a>, which came with many
bugfixes and improvements to libraries and has seen much work in the
MLRISC backend.  There were also numerous updates to many other parts
of the system.  110.40 succeeded a mostly-bugfix release (<a
href="NEWS/110.39-README.html">110.39</a>) and built on <a
href="NEWS/110.38-README.html">110.38</a> which provided internal
improvements to MLRISC and overhauled the FFI. The version before that
(<a href="NEWS/110.37-README.html">110.37</a>) came with some
enhancements to CM and more improvements to the MLRISC backend. All
working releases since <a href="NEWS/110.35-README">110.35</a> are
based on a new organization of compiler source code into CM libraries,
run under the new Mac OS X, include Matthias Blume's new, experimental
FFI (NLFFI) for x86-linux (and now sparc) and support CML as well as
eXene.

<p>Since working version 110.9.1, major internal changes have been
implemented and many changes are still in progress.  Version <a
href="NEWS/110.12-README">110.12</a> introduced fundamental changes in
array, vector and string representations and a new garbage collector
interface.  Extensive changes have also been made to the ML-RISC code
generators.</p>
                                                                        
                          
<p>Starting with <a href="NEWS/110.20-README.html">110.20</a>, a major
overhaul of the CM compilation manager has been in progress,
accompanied with a reorganization of the compiler itself into a set of
libraries.</p>
                                                                        
                          
<p>The next working release will incorporate an updated version of the
FLINT middle end.  At this point, we will change the way the code is
managed by having a publically accessible CVS repository at Yale.</p>
                                                                        
                          
<p>As usual, use the working versions at your own risk. 
Some working versions incorporate substantial changes that reduce stability 
and introduce bugs.</p>
