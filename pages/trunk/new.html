  <blockquote> <a name="macosx">The recently released  </a><a href="NEWS/110.33-README.html">
  110.33</a> working version runs under Mac OS X.  It also introduces Matthias
 Blume's new, experimental FFI, NLFFI ("No-Longer Foreign Function Interface"). 
 Currently NLFFI is available only under x86-linux, but it is being ported
 to other architectures. </blockquote>

    <blockquote> <a name="smlnj.exe">The original version of the Windows
installer, smlnj.exe, for 110.0.7 had a problem when running under Windows
95/98/ME that caused error messages abound undefined strings like PRODUCT_NAME.
 This problem has been corrected in a new  </a><a href="ftp://ftp.research.bell-labs.com/dist/smlnj/release/110/smlnj.exe">
  smlnj.exe</a> now available in the usual 110.0.7 <a href="ftp://ftp.research.bell-labs.com/dist/smlnj/release/110/">
   ftp</a> and  <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj/dist">http</a>
   distribution directories.                 
      <p> This new smlnj.exe (as of 23 March 01) also corrects a problem
where installation only set the user PATH and CM_PATH environment variables.
 Now the installer sets these variables at the system level for all users.
 Installation must be done from an administrator account. </p>

   </a>                           
            <blockquote> A new minor release version <a href="NEWS/110-README.html">
  110.0.7</a> is now available.  This is the sixth patch release for version
 110 (110.0.4 was not released).  This patch release fixes a long-standing 
 bug in signal handling.  It also includes a number of SML/NJ Library enhancements
 and fixes and some fixes to CM and eXene, and a small number of other bug
 fixes.  See the <a href="NEWS/110-PATCH-HISTORY">110-PATCH-HISTORY</a> file
 for       details. With this release, we are also making the distribution
 files available for download via http as well as ftp.  See the <a href="dist/110.0.7.html">
  110.0.7 distribution page</a>. [<strong>Note:</strong> The original smlnj.exe
 installer for Windows had incorrect CM tool paths.  This has been corrected
 by a new smlnj.exe as of October 18, 2000.] </blockquote>

   </a>                               
              <blockquote> Meanwhile, work continues on the next release,
 which we hope to have ready for a beta release "real soon now". The next
release will not contain any major language or Basis library changes, but
there will be major internal changes, including:                        
          
                <ul>
   <li>A new runtime system with improved management of virtual memory. </li>
                    <li>New support for foreign functions (C) based on IDL. 
                   </li>
                    <li>Conformance with the soon to be published SML Basis
 spec. </li>
                    <li>MLRISC code generators for all architectures. </li>
                    <li>The FLINT representation has partially replaced the
 old cps representation in the back end. </li>
                                   
                </ul>
   In addition, there will be a couple significant language extensions: lazy
 datatypes and lazy functions over such datatypes, functional record concatenation
 (a "with" operation), and mutable records whose fields can be updated. 
                                 
                <p> Most features of Version 111 are implemented in current
 working versions.  The main missing elements are the new runtime system
and  a MIPS code generator. </p>

 is </a><a href="NEWS/110.37-README.html">110.37</a>. &nbsp;It provides some
enhancements to CM and improvements to the MLRISC backend. &nbsp;The previous
release, <a href="NEWS/110.36-README.html">110.36</a>, fixed a few important
 bugs. All working releases since <a href="NEWS/110.35-README">110.35</a>
 are based on a new  organization of compiler source code into CM libraries,
run under the new  Mac OS X, include Matthias Blume's new, experimental FFI
(NLFFI) for x86-linux  and support CML as well as eXene.                
                      
                  <p> Since working version 110.9.1, major internal changes
 have been implemented and many changes are still in progress.  Version <a href="NEWS/110.12-README">
  110.12</a> introduced fundamental changes in array, vector and string representations
 and a new garbage collector interface.  Extensive changes have also been
made to the ML-RISC code generators. </p>
                                       
                  <p> Starting with <a href="NEWS/110.20-README.html">110.20</a>
  , a major overhaul of the CM compilation manager has been in progress,
accompanied  with a reorganization of the compiler itself into a set of libraries.
                  </p>
                                       
                  <p> The next working release will incorporate an updated
 version of the FLINT middle end.  At this point, we will change the way
the  code is managed by having a publically accessible CVS repository at
Yale.                    </p>
                                       
                  <p> As usual, use the working versions at your own risk.
  Some working versions incorporate substantial changes that reduce stability
 and introduce bugs. </p>
