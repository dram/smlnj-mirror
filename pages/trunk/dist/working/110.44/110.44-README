Summary:

Again, there are a number of important bug fixes and updates, mostly
to the Basis library and the installer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Details:
========

Basis:
------

 - fixed bugs and improved code for Real.{from,to}LargeInt
 - fixed bug in Posix.ProcEnv.times
 - changed inputLine functions to return an option
 - implemented native int32->real64 conversion
 - slices implemented according to spec
 - Time.{from,to}NanoSeconds added to Time
 - made SOCKET API match the spec
 - OS-specific details of socket implementation moved into separate files
   (this makes it possible to share the bulk of the code between Unix and
   Win32)
 - added signature SYNCHRONOUS_SOCKET to Basis
 - precision of real64 is 53 (not 52)
 - added openVector, nullRd, and nullWr to PRIM_IO

Installer:
----------

 - new installer (which is mostly written in SML) is no longer optional
   (old installer has been removed)
 - the ML code of the installer is now in its own library and gets
   compiled by CMB.make; the installer script simply invokes
     sml -m $smlnj/installer.cm
   (the ML code does not have to be compiled as part of the installation
    process)
 - minor improvements and bugfixes
 - sense environment variable CM_DIR_ARC that lets one override the
   default name for CM meta-data (default is .cm -- see CM section)
 - sense value of INSTALLDIR environment variable and behave accordingly
 - "dont_move_libraries" directive eliminated from config/targets
   (This was a legacy mechanism which turned out to be broken anyway.)

Scripts:
--------

 - changed default @SMLalloc parameter for x86/celeron to 64k
 - made .bat-files Win95-compatible

CM:
---

 - default name of meta-data directory changed from CM to .cm
 - a different name can be chosen at installation time
 - added missing wrapper for privilege "primitive" in $smlnj/viscomp/core.cm

CML:
----

 - tracked Basis changes
   (non-blocking Socket functions are left out since they are redundant:
    CML_SOCKET is defined in terms of SYNCHRONOUS_SOCKET)
 - make use of non-blocking socket functions from Basis; CML socket
   implementation is now OS-independent

Interactive loop:
-----------------

 - added hook to prettyprinter so it can invoke the autoloader if
   a qid to be printed is not currently bound in the toplevel environment;
   this eliminates many instances where the prettyprinter used to
   print "?" in front of a name

MLRISC:
-------

 - minor bug fixes

runtime:
--------

 - works with Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther)
