</b><br/>
        This working version is believed to be stable, and 
        has passed the regression test suite. However, there is
        quite a bit of new code in the FLINT middle end and 
        at the interface between the Front End and FLINT, so
        this is not considered a mature working release.

<h3>Summary:</h3>

This release includes new code merged from the primop-branch-3 development
branch. Many of the changes affect FLINT and its interaction with the
front end, and particularly the system for supporting primops
(primitive operations).
 
<h3>Details:</h3>

<dl>

  <dt>Front End and FLINT:</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Implemented a new scheme for defining primops and tracking
        and analyzing their types in the type checker and in FLINT.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improved signature printing by making it faithfully reflect
        the original order of specification or definition.
      </li>
      <li>
        Began to streamline the type system of the plambda and flint
        intermediate languages.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed some minor bugs in the type checker and module system.
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>SML Basis library:</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Fixed a bug in the implementation of order operations
        and min and max for Int32. Fixed a few other bugs in the Basis
        that were revealed by running the regression tests.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>Regression Tests:</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Revised the regression test suite and brought the tests and
        reference outputs up to date.  Cleaned up test scripts.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>ml-lpt:</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
       Major revisions, including addition of a table-based mode for
       lexical analyzers with large numbers of states.
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>runtime:</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
    </ul>
  </dd>
