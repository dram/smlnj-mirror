<h1>Installation instructions for SML/NJ under Windows</h1>

We now provide a Microsoft Installer package for SML/NJ.
The installer contains a full installation including
nearly all optional components.  (We only exclude
"mlrisc-tools" and "nowhere".)

You can choose the installation directory. The default
is <tt>C:\Program Files\SMLNJ</tt>. The bin directory containing
the sml command is added to the default PATH, though
note that you will need to re-open command windows to see
the binding. The SMLNJ_HOME environment variable is also
set up to point at the location that SML/NJ was installed.

You can either launch the interpreter directly from a 
Start Menu entry or by opening a command prompt and 
typing "<tt>sml</tt>".

<hr />

To compile from scratch, assuming Microsoft Visual Studio or
at least the Visual C++ Express Edition and the Platform SDK:

<ul>
<li> Run "vcvars32" command or open the "Visual Studio Command
Prompt" menu item.
<li> Create the full SML/NJ source hierarchy
   (most convenient: do a CVS checkout; alternative: unzip
    and untar all the source archives).
<li> Unzip and untar <tt>boot.x86-win32.tgz</tt> into the root of the
source tree.
<li> Set environment variable SMLNJ_HOME to root of source tree.
<li> Edit config\targets to one's taste.
<li> Run <tt>config\install.bat</tt>.
<li> To generate the msi, run <tt>config\WinSetup\buildSetup.bat</tt>.
</ul>
