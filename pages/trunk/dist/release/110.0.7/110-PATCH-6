                    Version 110.0.6, October 31, 1999
                    ----------------------------------


       http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj/index.html

This is the fifth patch release for version 110 (110.0.4 was not released).
The primary purpose of this update is to fix problems in CML, but a number
of other bug fixes are included, as well as some enhancements.


Recent Bug Fixes
----------------
Numbered bugs fixed in this patch version:
  1294. Real.fromString accepts too much
  1359. unexpected diagnostic message
  1407. ARRAY does not agree with Basis Library spec
  1448. Real.round does not round to nearest even for ties
  1525. Array2 bug
  1530. ListSetFn should have opaque result [smlnj-lib]


SML/NJ Library
--------------

 o Fixed bug in RedBlack trees (the linear time construction of
   trees from ordered sequences was producing backwards trees).

 o Changed UREF signature so that union, unify, and link operations
   now return a boolean.

 o Added peekFn to PropList.newProp return result.

 o Added TextIOPP structure to pp-lib.cm (it was not being exported).

 o Changed the getOpt API.  Errors are now reported using a callback
   and both usage and getOpt take records as arguments.  Also changed
   the NoArg descriptor to take a function so that imperative argument
   processing can be supported.

 o Changed CM files to be compatible with both the old (110.0.x) and
   new (110.20+) versions of CM.


Platforms:
----------

  We have built and tested (with the regression suites) this version
  on the following platforms:

     x86-linux (Red Hat 5.1, Linux 2.0.35; Red Hat 6.0, Linux 2.2.5-22)
     x86-win32 (Windows NT 4.0)
     x86-freeBSD (FreeBSD 3.2 - built but not tested)
     sparc-solaris  (UltraSparc II, Solaris 2.5.1)
     alpha32-dunix  (Digital Unix 4.0)
     hppa-hpux (HPUX 10.20)
     mipseb-irix6 (R10000, IRIX 6.4)

  The system should build on rs6000-aix, but we no longer have access to
  an rs6000-aix machine for testing.  Any volunteers?  This version will
  not run on more recent PowerPC-based RS6000 machines, but current working
  versions of SML/NJ will run under powerpc-aix.
