			Standard ML of New Jersey
		    Version 110.0.1, January 12, 1998
		    ---------------------------------

This is the first patch release for version 110.  It fixes a few serious bugs
that slipped through in version 110, as well as adding a couple of new features.


Recent Bug Fixes

Numbered bugs fixed in this patch version:

891. mllex state names not as general as advertized
997. lexgen doesn't check for unmatched quotes
1209. casting polymorphic functions and abstract types
1318. incorrect sigmatch error in higher-order functor

Other changes
-------------

  - It is now possible to turn GC messages off and on, by using the function
    SMLofNJ.Internals.GC.messages

  - The implementation of OS.IO.poll has been fixed to agree with the basis
    specification (order of results matches order of arguments).

  - A potential infinite loop in runtime/c-libs/posix-filesys/getcwd.c was
    fixed.

  - Added a clear operation to the Queue and various hash table structures in
    the SML/NJ library.


			Standard ML of New Jersey
		    Version 110.0.2, January 16, 1998
		    ---------------------------------

This is the second patch release for version 110.  It fixes a few serious bugs
that slipped through in version 110 (and 110.0.1), as well as adding a couple
of new features.  See the file 110-PATCH-1 for information on 110.0.1.


Recent Bug Fixes
----------------
Numbered bugs fixed in this patch version:
1335. nonexhaustive match failure in mips code generator
1337. exportFn in CML produces large images
1338. uncaught Unbound while compiling MLKit


Other changes
-------------

The Windows 95/NT version is now distributed as an InstallShield(tm)
package (110-smlnj.exe).  This is a self-extracting archive. You execute
it, it unpacks, and starts up the setup program by itself. From that point,
it's pretty standard installation procedure common on Windows. The only
thing maybe to note is that a reboot is strongly advised, to have the
changes to the registry (PATH env. variable and such) take effect. Note
that the archive does not contain the source code, except for the SML/NJ
Library, which is provided in source, and the ml-yacc library. If one
wants the source of ml-lex, ml-yacc, ml-burg, the runtime, the compiler,
or CM, you have to download the appropriate compressed tar file.

			Standard ML of New Jersey
		    Version 110.0.3, January 30, 1998
		    ---------------------------------

This is the third patch release for version 110.  It fixes a few serious bugs
that slipped through in the earlier patch releases.  See the files 110-README,
110-PATCH-1, and 110-PATCH-2 for additional information.


Recent Bug Fixes
----------------
Numbered bugs fixed in this patch version:
1047. Not very random, random number generator ... (smlnj-lib)
1337. exportFn in CML produces large images*
1340. Segmentation fault on Sparc, x86, Alpha, and MIPS
 -    Match exception related to span dependent loads on the hppa.

* we thought that this had been fixed in 110.0.2, but were mistaken.


Other changes
-------------

Problems with the InstallShield installation on Windows95 have been
fixed.

Installation problems under Linux have been fixed.

Installation problems under gcc 2.8.0 on the x86 have been fixed.

Made some minor additions to the Util library in the SML/NJ Library.

Added the GetDpy utility module to eXene.  This provides simple support
for getting the display and authentication information.

                    Version 110.0.5, September 9, 1999
                    ----------------------------------


       http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj/index.html

This is the fourth patch release for version 110 (110.0.4 was not released).
The primary purpose of this update is to fix problems in CML, but a number
of other bug fixes are included, as well as some enhancements.

Recent Bug Fixes
----------------
Numbered bugs fixed in this patch version:
  1302. handling differing newline conventions across OSes
  1352  Equality status of reals is compromised
  1354. spurious? "possibly inconsistent structure definitions"
  1357. rebinding of constructors and exceptions not allowed
  1365. datatype representation across functor boundary
  1368. 1+2 = 102 in IntInf  [in library]
  1369. Unbound exception on structure sharing violation
  1374. Datatype replication causes nonexhaustive match error.
  1377. OS.FileSys.tmpName differs in unspecified behaviour on Windows and Unix
  1382. space leak in CML
  1384. incorrect complaint about "inconsistent structure definitions"
  1386. redefinition of a type spec is not detected
  1391. Compiler bug - TransTypes: unexpected wildcard-type in toTyc
  1421. incorrect type comparison for val spec in signature match
  1432. signature match fails for datatype specs if "where type" is used
  1450. bugs in Array2.fromList and Array2.row
  1463. Broken ARRAY2 Code
  1477. assembler syntax nits for X86.prim.asm
  1500. Runtime system on Linux with glibc2
  1503. redefinition of `struct sigcontext' under red hat 6.0

Other bug fixes:
  Installation problems under Irix6.5 and RedHat 6.0 have been fixed.


CM
--

 o Made changes in the lexing/parsing of source.cm files so that the
   same files can work both with 110.0.5 and the new CM introduced with
   110.20.


SML/NJ Library
--------------

 o The Pretty printing and regular expression libraries are now built
   as part of the SML/NJ Library installation.

 o New implementations of functional sets and maps based on Chris Okasaki's
   red-black tree implementation.  These are significantly faster than the
   balanced binary tree implementations for most operations (the main exception
   is union, which is slightly slower).

 o A number of other new modules and minor bug fixes (see smlnj-lib/CHANGES
   for details).


Concurrent ML
-------------

 o CML now runs under  WindowsNT (and probably Windows98).  Support for sockets
   on Windows is also included.


eXene
-----

Various bug fixes; see eXene/CHANGES for details.

                        Standard ML of New Jersey
                    Version 110.0.6, October 31, 1999
                    ----------------------------------


       http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj/index.html

This is the fifth patch release for version 110 (110.0.4 was not released).
The primary purpose of this update is to fix problems in CML, but a number
of other bug fixes are included, as well as some enhancements.


Recent Bug Fixes
----------------
Numbered bugs fixed in this patch version:
  1294. Real.fromString accepts too much
  1359. unexpected diagnostic message
  1407. ARRAY does not agree with Basis Library spec
  1448. Real.round does not round to nearest even for ties
  1525. Array2 bug
  1530. ListSetFn should have opaque result [smlnj-lib]


SML/NJ Library
--------------

 o Fixed bug in RedBlack trees (the linear time construction of
   trees from ordered sequences was producing backwards trees).

 o Changed UREF signature so that union, unify, and link operations
   now return a boolean.

 o Added peekFn to PropList.newProp return result.

 o Added TextIOPP structure to pp-lib.cm (it was not being exported).

 o Changed the getOpt API.  Errors are now reported using a callback
   and both usage and getOpt take records as arguments.  Also changed
   the NoArg descriptor to take a function so that imperative argument
   processing can be supported.

 o Changed CM files to be compatible with both the old (110.0.x) and
   new (110.20+) versions of CM.


Platforms:
----------

  We have built 110.0.6 and tested it with the regression suites
  on the following platforms:

     x86-linux (Red Hat 5.1, Linux 2.0.35; Red Hat 6.0, Linux 2.2.5-22)
     x86-win32 (Windows NT 4.0)
     x86-freeBSD (FreeBSD 3.2 - built but not tested)
     sparc-solaris  (UltraSparc II, Solaris 2.5.1)
     alpha32-dunix  (Digital Unix 4.0)
     hppa-hpux (HPUX 10.20)
     mipseb-irix6 (R10000, IRIX 6.4)

  The system should build on rs6000-aix, but we no longer have access to
  an rs6000-aix machine for testing.  Any volunteers?  This version will
  not run on more recent PowerPC-based RS6000 machines, but current working
  versions of SML/NJ will run under powerpc-aix.

SML/NJ Library
--------------

   of items in the table was not being recomputed.

 o Added modify and modifyi iterators to hash tables.

 o Added anchorLink style to HTMLDev structure in PP/devices.

 o Added IntHashTable structure to Util library; this structure is
   a specialization of hash tables to integer keys.

 o Added default cases to avoid "match not exhaustive" warnings.

 o Added GraphSCCFn functor to Util library, which implements a
   strongly-connected components algorithm on directed graphs (written
   by Matthias Blume).


CML
