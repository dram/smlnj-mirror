This is the sixth patch release for version 110 (110.0.4 was not released).
This patch release fixes a long-standing bug in signal handling.  It also
includes a number of SML/NJ Library enhancements and fixes.


Recent Bug Fixes
----------------
Numbered bugs fixed in this patch version:
  1498. Specialized real arrays not pretty-printed correctly
  1510. Signature matching bug makes "casts" possible
  1556.	signal race condition
  1559. non-empty string matches regular expression only in a non-empty way
  1576. buggy Real.!=


SML/NJ Library
--------------

 o Added Word versions of hash tables (WordHashTable), finite 
   maps (WordRedBlackMap), and sets (WordRedBlackSet).

 o fixed bug in Format module (infinity caused infinite loop).

 o added anchored paths in CM files for NEW_CM.

 o added implementation of LWORD in Format module.

 o Fixed bug in dfa-engine.sml (bug number 1559).

 o Added setFn to PList.newProp return type.

 o Added sameHolder function to PropList module.

 o Fixed a bug in the filter/filteri hash table functions: the number
   of items in the table was not being recomputed.

 o Added modify and modifyi iterators to hash tables.

 o Added anchorLink style to HTMLDev structure in PP/devices.

 o Added IntHashTable structure to Util library; this structure is
   a specialization of hash tables to integer keys.

 o Added default cases to avoid "match not exhaustive" warnings.

 o Added GraphSCCFn functor to Util library, which implements a
   strongly-connected components algorithm on directed graphs (written
   by Matthias Blume).


CML
---

 o Fixed some bugs in the withNack implementation.

 o Modified RunCML.doit to install a dummy print hook.


eXene
-----

 o Updated the examples directory so that all of the example programs
   will compile.


Platforms:
----------

  We have built and tested (with the regression suites) this version
  on the following platforms:

     x86-linux (Red Hat 5.1, Linux 2.0.35; Red Hat 6.1-2, Red Hat 7.0)
     x86-win32 (Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000)
     x86-freeBSD (FreeBSD 3.2 - built but not tested)
     sparc-solaris  (UltraSparc II, Solaris 2.5.1)
     alpha32-dunix  (Digital Unix 4.0)
     hppa-hpux (HPUX 10.20)
     mipseb-irix6 (R10000, IRIX 6.5)

  The system should build on rs6000-aix, but we no longer have access to
  an rs6000-aix machine for testing.  Any volunteers?  This version will
  not run on more recent PowerPC-based RS6000 machines, but current working
  versions of SML/NJ will run under powerpc-aix.
