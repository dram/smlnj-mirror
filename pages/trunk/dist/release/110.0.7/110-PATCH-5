This is the fourth patch release for version 110 (110.0.4 was not released).
The primary purpose of this update is to fix problems in CML, but a number
of other bug fixes are included, as well as some enhancements.

Recent Bug Fixes
----------------
Numbered bugs fixed in this patch version:
  1302. handling differing newline conventions across OSes
  1352  Equality status of reals is compromised
  1354. spurious? "possibly inconsistent structure definitions"
  1357. rebinding of constructors and exceptions not allowed
  1365. datatype representation across functor boundary
  1368. 1+2 = 102 in IntInf  [in library]
  1369. Unbound exception on structure sharing violation
  1374. Datatype replication causes nonexhaustive match error.
  1377. OS.FileSys.tmpName differs in unspecified behaviour on Windows and Unix
  1382. space leak in CML
  1384. incorrect complaint about "inconsistent structure definitions"
  1386. redefinition of a type spec is not detected
  1391. Compiler bug - TransTypes: unexpected wildcard-type in toTyc
  1421. incorrect type comparison for val spec in signature match
  1432. signature match fails for datatype specs if "where type" is used
  1450. bugs in Array2.fromList and Array2.row
  1463. Broken ARRAY2 Code
  1477. assembler syntax nits for X86.prim.asm
  1500. Runtime system on Linux with glibc2
  1503. redefinition of `struct sigcontext' under red hat 6.0

Other bug fixes:
  Installation problems under Irix6.5 and RedHat 6.0 have been fixed.


CM
--

 o Made changes in the lexing/parsing of source.cm files so that the
   same files can work both with 110.0.5 and the new CM introduced with
   110.20.


SML/NJ Library
--------------

 o The Pretty printing and regular expression libraries are now built
   as part of the SML/NJ Library installation.

 o New implementations of functional sets and maps based on Chris Okasaki's
   red-black tree implementation.  These are significantly faster than the
   balanced binary tree implementations for most operations (the main exception
   is union, which is slightly slower).

 o A number of other new modules and minor bug fixes (see smlnj-lib/CHANGES
   for details).


Concurrent ML
-------------

 o CML now runs under  WindowsNT (and probably Windows98).  Support for sockets
   on Windows is also included.


eXene
-----

Various bug fixes; see eXene/CHANGES for details.


Platforms:
----------

  We have built and tested (with the regression suites) this version
  on the following platforms:

     x86-linux (Red Hat 5.1, Linux 2.0.35)
     x86-win32
     sparc-solaris  (UltraSparc II, Solaris 2.5.1)
     alpha32-dunix  (Digital Unix 4.0)
     hppa-hpux (HPUX 10.20)
     mipseb-irix6 (R10000, IRIX 6.4)

  The system should build on rs6000-aix, but we no longer have access to
  an rs6000-aix machine for testing.  Any volunteers?
