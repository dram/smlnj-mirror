						March 2, 1998.


This directory contains a collections of benchmarks that have
frequently been used to evaluate the performance of SML/NJ. 
The directories SML97 and 93 refer to versions of the benchmarks that
run under the SML'97 (vesion 110 and higer) and version 93 release of
SML/NJ.   

Each directory contains a script called runit. To invoke it, the shell
variable SML must be set to the path for the SML/NJ compiler. 'runit'
executed at the top level will create a file called LOG that contains
the results of compiling and running each benchmark. 

Executing 
	runit -help 

will show command line options.

If you know of other benchmarks that would be useful to add to this
suite, please let me know.
