Record of builds from source of 110.94
--------------------------------------

MacOS

1. MacOS 10.14.6 (iMac late 2015)
   a. ARCH=x86 (32-bit)
      OPSYS=darwin (18.7.0)
      Xcode 11.2, with macOSX10.13.sdk added in
        Xcode/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX/Developer/SDKs
      command: config/install.sh
   b. ARCH=amd64 (64-bit)
      OPSYS=darwin (18.7.0)
      Xcode 11.2, with only default macOSX10.15.sdk
      command: config/install.sh -default 64

2. MacOS 10.15.1 (MacBook Pro, late 2013)
   ARCH=amd64
   OPSYS=darwin (19.0.0)
   Xcode 11.2, with only default macOSX10.15.sdk
   64-bit: config/install.sh -default 64


Linux

1 Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS (64 bit); generic 2016 PC build, 4GHz Core i7 proceesor
  a. ARCH=x86 (32 bit)
     OPSYS=linux
     (see below for 32-bit support packages installed)
     command: config/install.sh
  b. ARCH=amd64 (64 bit)
     OPSYS=linux
     command: config/install.sh -default 64
     
Note: For the 32-bit build, first followed instructions for
"recent version [sic] of Ubuntu" in dist/working/110.94/INSTALL:

      dpkg --add-architecture i386
      apt-get update
      apt-get install libc6:i386
  
but this was not sufficient to compile the runtime, so needed
to add:

      apt-get install gcc-multilib
      apt-get install g++-multilib

after which runtime compiled successfully. So I don't know if
libc6:i386 was actually necessary.

64-bit compile was in the same environment, with these 32-bit
packages installed, so haven't tested 64-bit build without
these packages. Could uninstall them and test the 64-bit build
again.

QUESTION: On all recent (64 bit) Linux systems with basic
tool chain (gcc, etc.) installed, does the 64 bit build succeed
without needing additional 32-bit support packages?

INSTALL needs to be updated. Also, it should be formated as
HTML since plain text is mangled by Microsoft Edge.


Windows 10 (64 bit, Version 1903)
  Visual Studio Community 2019, Version 16.3.7
  
Note: where are the current, up-to-date instructions for building
the compiler from source on Windows 10 with Visual Studio Community?
There are two possible files:

    dev-notes/windows10-installer.txt
    dist/working/110.94/WININSTALL.html

Neither of these seems up-to-date and correct.  For instance,
the file base/runtime/c-lib/win32/win32-debug.c mentioned in
windows10-installer.txt does not exist.
