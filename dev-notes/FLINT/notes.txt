* FLINT middle-end was introduced in SML/NJ 109.24 (before 2003).  [Monnier-phd-2003.pdf, Chpt 2, p 6].

* SML/NJ 110.0 released sometime shortly after 10/20/2000.
This narrows the time interval for 109.24 to 10/2000 -- 12/2003 (Monnier's thesis).

Monnier's thesis mentioned 109.24 as a version incorporating FLINT.
Zhong Shao et al also mention 109.24 (dated January 1997) in
"Implementing Typed Intermediate Languages", published 1998.

109.32 may be the last point release before 110, produced around the
end of 1997 or beginning of 1998.  The 110 release came in early 1998.
