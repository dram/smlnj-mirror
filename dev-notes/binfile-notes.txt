Notes on binfiles.adoc

1. [line 22] Section title should indicate that this is the _old_ binfile layout (used in 110.99 and earlier?). I assume, for instance, that the 2nd field ("pickle of exported lambda-expr" is obsolete. Also, where does the "r" in line 35 come from?  Should it be "g" rather than "r", or the other way around?

Should the Size column for "end of file" be 0 (zero)?

2. [line 67] Does the seven character limit for the architecture include the "<"
and ">" characters surrounding the actual architecture string?  E.g. "<amd64>" is
7 characters?  Same for the "version" part: does it include "<" and ">" characters?
Also "version" of what? The SML/NJ compiler, or the binfile format version.
For example, is "<amd64>-<2022.10>" a possible magic string? Actually, it would
seem to violate the 8 character limit on the version part, because "<2022.10>" is
9 characters. (Note the use of "version" on line 73.)

3. [line 74] "BinFie " is presumably a misspelling. Should be "BinFile ".

4. [line 81] "version number is a date. Is this normally the date when a the current
binfile format was introduced?  It changes only when a new binfile format is introduced?
The phrase "date of the version" on line 103 needs clarification?
Then on line 83 there is another field for "version number", which appears to be the
SML/NJ release version number. This is slightly confusing.

5. Do the terms "GUID" and "GUID area" need definitions or explanations?

6. [line 162] Spelling: "immediatly".
