TODO list for type checker overhaul

---------------
Front-end types
---------------

* Deal with unnecessary ?.t printing of types (and structures, etc.)

* Type checker produces "reduced" or "simplified" typed abstract syntax
  -- eliminate artifacts of the type inference algorithm like type metavariables
  -- compact type representations (fully "pruned")
  -- explicit binding of polymorphic type variables
     ** introduce explicit type abstractions around polymorphic expressions
     ** explicit type applications to instantiate applied occurrences of polymorphic
        variables
  -- "real" type variables replace certain "kinds" of type metavariables (LBOUND)

* Fix as many type-related bugs as possible

------------
FLINT types
------------

* drastically simplify FLINT plambda/Flint types
  -- replace Nadathur closures by a simpler form
  -- experiment to see what the current benefit/necessity is for hash-consing types

* try to simplify translation from explicitly typed absyn to typed plambda
