We plan to migrate the SML/NJ project to GitHub over the spring/summer
of 2022.  We will take this opportunity to reorganize the structure of
the repository.

The following is a proposal for organizing the repository on GitHub.
The basic idea is that core pieces of the system are in top-level
directories, while support tools and libraries are in the `tools`
and `libraries` directories.

smlnj/
        basis-lib/                      -- SML Basis Library + SML/NJ Basis
        cm/                             -- compilation manager
        libraries/
                ckit/
                cml/
        runtime/                        -- runtime system
        sml/                            -- interactive system
        smlc-lib/                       -- compiler library
        smlnj-lib/                      -- SML/NJ libraries
        tools/
                asdl
                ml-burg
                ml-lex
                ml-lpt
                ml-yacc
                nlffi
