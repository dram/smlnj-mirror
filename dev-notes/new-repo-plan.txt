# Migrating SML/NJ to GitHub

We plan to migrate the SML/NJ project to GitHub over the spring/summer
of 2022.  We will take this opportunity to reorganize the structure of
the repository.

The basic idea is that core pieces of the system are in top-level
directories, while support tools and libraries are in the `tools`
and `libraries` directories.

## Step 1

The first step is a partial reorganzation of the repository.  We preserve
the current organization of the `base` subdirectories, but lift them
up to top level.

smlnj/
    cm/                         -- compilation manager (old `base/cm`)
    compiler/                   -- the SML compiler (old `base/compiler`)
    libraries/                  -- additional libraries
        ckit/
        cml/
        eXene/
        MLRISC/
        old-basis/              -- 2004 version of SML Basis Library
        pgraph/
        trace-debug-profile/
    llvm/                       -- modified version of LLVM that supports JWA
    make-dist/                  -- support for packaging releases as installers
        macos/                  -- support for building macOS PKG file
        windows/                -- support for building Windows MSI file
    runtime/                    -- runtime system
    smlnj-lib/                  -- SML/NJ libraries
    system/                     -- bootstrapping (the old `base/system`)
    tools/
        asdl
        heap2asm
        ml-burg
        ml-lpt                  -- ml-antlr and ml-ulex tool
        ml-yacc
        nlffi

## Step 2

In the second step, we reorganize the compiler into a collection of libraries
(essentially a replacement for the "visible compiler") that can be used to
implement standalone tools, such as a LSP server.  The stuff that is currently
in `base/system` would be split across the `basis-lib`, `cm`, and `sml`
directories.

smlnj/
        basis-lib/                      -- SML Basis Library + SML/NJ Basis
        cm/                             -- compilation manager
        libraries/                      -- additional libraries
                ckit/
                cml/
                eXene/
                MLRISC/
                old-basis/              -- 2004 version of SML Basis Library
                pgraph/
                trace-debug-profile/
        llvm/                           -- modified version of LLVM that supports JWA
        make-dist/                      -- support for packaging releases as installers
            macos/                      -- support for building macOS PKG file
            windows/                    -- support for building Windows MSI file
        runtime/                        -- runtime system
        sml/                            -- interactive system
        smlc-lib/                       -- compiler library
        smlnj-lib/                      -- SML/NJ libraries
        tools/
                asdl
                heap2asm
                ml-build
                ml-burg
                ml-lpt                  -- ml-antlr and ml-ulex tool
                ml-makedepend
                ml-yacc
                nlffi
                smldoc                  -- signature documentation tool (under development)

Note that some of the tools (*i.e.*, `asdl`, `ml-lpt`, and `nlffi`) have support
libraries that we might want to split out into the `libraries` directory.  We might
also want to move `smlc-lib` and `smlnj-lib` directories into `libraries`.
