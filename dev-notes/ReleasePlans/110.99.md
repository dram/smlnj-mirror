# Plans for the 110.99 release

The 110.99 release will be the last to use the old version numbering scheme.
It is scheduled for late December 2020 (maybe a Christmas release?)

## Bug fixes

  * Bug in 64-bit arithmetic on 32-bit machines (267)

  * Bug in converting from LargeInt to real in (254)

  * Pretty printer bugs (274, 276, 277)

  * Bad error message in ml-ulex (275).  A proper fix requires rewriting the front
    end of the ml-ulex tool to use a proper parse-tree representation, instead of
    trying to do error checking during parsing.  Fixing it may need to be pushed
    off to the next release.

## Other changes

  * reorganize AMD64 stack layout to support LLVM spilling conventions
