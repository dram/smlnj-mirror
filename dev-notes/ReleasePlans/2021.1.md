# Plans for the 2021.1 release

This will be the first release in 2021 and the first to use the new version
numbering scheme.

## Bug fixes

  * Bad error message in ml-ulex (275).  A proper fix requires rewriting the front
    end of the ml-ulex tool to use a proper parse-tree representation, instead of
    trying to do error checking during parsing.  Fixing it may need to be pushed
    off to the next release.

## Arm64 support

A first release of the Arm64 port, which is planned to use the new LLVM backend.
This depends, of course, on success in getting LLVM to work as a substitute for
MLRisc.
