# Plans for the 2021.1 release

This will be the first release in 2021 and the first to use the new version
numbering scheme.

## Arm64 support

A first release of the Arm64 port, which is planned to use the new LLVM backend.
This depends, of course, on success in getting LLVM to work as a substitute for
MLRisc.
