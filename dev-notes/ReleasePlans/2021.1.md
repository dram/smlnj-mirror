# Plans for the 2021.1 release

This will be the first release in 2021 and the first to use the new version
numbering scheme.

## Bug fixes

  * Bad error message in ml-ulex (275).  A proper fix requires rewriting the front
    end of the ml-ulex tool to use a proper parse-tree representation, instead of
    trying to do error checking during parsing.  Fixing it may need to be pushed
    off to the next release.

## Arm64 support

  * Switch to the LLVM backend with only 64-bit support

  * First release of the Arm64 port

## Other changes

  * new pattern-matching code

  * move FLINT related functions from CPS/cps/cpsutil.sml to CPS/convert
    directory (either merge them into convert.sml or have a convert-util.sml
    file).
