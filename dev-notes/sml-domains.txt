Notes
-----
The plan is to have all six domains registered at Google Domains after
sml-family.org and successor-ml.org become transferable on 2020.05.21.

Google Domains charges $12/year for .org domains.

Troubleshooting

Message on GitHub.com website admin page when setting custom domain:

"Your site's DNS settings are using a custom subdomain, smlfamily.org,
that's set up with an AAAA record. GitHub Pages currently does not
support IPv6. For more information, see
https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/."
