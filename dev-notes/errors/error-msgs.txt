1. Qualified identifiers versus variables
../compiler/FLINT/opt/fcontract.sml:1024.12-1024.23 Error: variable found where constructor is required: F.RK_STRUCT

  a variable could never have the lexical form "F.RK_STRUCT" (i.e. no qualified identifier should
  be considered a variable


2. Undefined type constraint
../compiler/FLINT/opt/loopify.sml:73.15-73.34 Error: pattern and constraint do not agree [type mismatch]
  pattern:    {isrec:'Y; 'Z}
  constraint:    [E]
  in pattern:
    {isrec=isrec,...} : [E]
)
  Here [E] denotes a type constraint F.fkind where F.fkind is not
  defined (should have been LT.fkind).
  
3. source file "regions" and their "printing"
In Basics/errormsg/errormsg.sml, Ramsey has introduced major, no
longer necessary complications because of (* #line... *) inline
directives (& literate programming?), which probably no longer work
after not having been maintained for decades.  Go back to a simpler
treatment.
