Test cases:
===========

Currently, there are 4 test cases -- each in its own subdirectory:

    intr/
           A potentially long-running C function to demonstrate how
           interrupts get suspended but properly remembered if they
           occur within C code.
    math/
           Various <math.h> routines.
    pdb/
           A more substantial example (a "person data base").  The
           logic and datastructures in this example are intentionally
           much more clumsy, strange, and awkward than any reasonable
           C programmer would make them.  But they serve to stress-test
           some of the features of NLFFI.
    printf/
           An example demonstrating an existing (but very clumsy)
           workaround for the varargs problem.  (The problem is that
           currently there is no NLFFI type encoding variadic C
           functions.)

For intr/ and pdb/ you first need to build the corresponding shared
library.  See README in the respective directory.

Eventually, you can compile each example <d> (where <d> ranges over
intr, math, pdb, and printf) by saying:

    cd <d>
    sml -m <d>.cm

Enjoy!
